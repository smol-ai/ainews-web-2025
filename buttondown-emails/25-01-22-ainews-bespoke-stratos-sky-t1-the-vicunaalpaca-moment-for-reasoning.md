> AI News for 1/21/2025-1/22/2025. We checked 7 subreddits, [**433** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **34** Discords (**225** channels, and **4297** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **496 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

In the ChatGPT heyday of 2022-23, [Alpaca and Vicuna](https://sapling.ai/llm/alpaca-vs-vicuna) were born out of LMsys and Stanford as ultra cheap ($300) finetunes of LLaMA 1 that distilled from ChatGPT/Bard samples to achieve 90% of the quality of ChatGPT/GPT3.5.

**In the last 48 hours, it seems the Berkeley/USC folks have done it again, this time with the reasoning models.**

It's hard to believe this sequence of events happened just in the last 2 weeks:

1. Berkeley's Sky Computing lab [released Sky-T1-32B-Preview](https://x.com/NovaSkyAI/status/1877793041957933347), a finetune of Qwen 2.5 32B ([our coverage here](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-o1-destroys-lmsys-arena-qwen-25-kyutai/)) with 17k rows of training data from QwQ-32B ([our coverage here](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-qwen-with-questions-32b-open-weights/)) + [rewriting traces with gpt-4o-mini + rejection sampling](https://x.com/TrelisResearch/status/1879530546038022623), **all done for $450**. Because QwQ outperforms o1-preview, distilling from QwQ brings Qwen up to **match** o1-preview's benchmarks: ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/d2026e95-5756-4266-ad56-21b21c75a5a3.png?w=960&fit=max) ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/1e1678a4-d885-4148-b588-c1f967979741.png?w=960&fit=max)
2. DeepSeek releases R1 ([2 days ago](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-deepseek-r1-o1-level-open-weights-model/)) with benchmarks far above o1-preview. The R1 paper also revealed the surprise that you can distill from R1 to **turn a 1.5B Qwen model to match 4o and 3.5 Sonnet** (?!).
3. Bespoke Labs (today) [uses the Sky-T1 recipe to distill R1 on Qwen again](https://x.com/madiator/status/1882131703927652762) to **greatly** outperform (not just match) o1-preview, again with [17k rows of reasoning traces](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bespokelabs/Bespoke-Stratos-17k?row=0). ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/2c7efe2e-2d81-41fb-9737-3a9c369602eb.png?w=960&fit=max) 

While Bespoke's distillation does not quite match DeepSeek's distillation in performance, they used 17k samples vs DeepSeek's 800k. It is pretty evident that they could keep going here if they wished.

The bigger shocking thing is that "**SFT is all you need**" - no major architecture changes are required for reasoning to happen, just feed in more (validated, rephrased) reasoning traces, backtracking and pivoting and all, and it seems like it will generalize well. **In all likelihood, this explains the relative efficiency of o1-mini and o3-mini vs their full size counterparts.**

- **Custom Loss Functions and Forward Passing Proposal**: A member proposed opening a PR related to **custom loss** and **custom forward functions** in RLHF, suggesting to also create a dedicated docs page for clarification.
  
  - They aim to remove all custom losses while providing documentation on adding them, facilitating the integration of new RLHF losses.
- **Updates Needed for Phi 4 PR**: The member acknowledged the **Phi 4 PR** and mentioned needing to fix a few points before proceeding further.
  
  - They expressed intent to iterate on it after addressing outstanding issues.
- **Context Needed for a New PR**: A member inquired whether there was any issue or discussion providing context for the PR in question.
  
  - The original poster confirmed a related discussion found in [issue #2206](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtune/issues/2206) regarding **custom contrastive losses**.
- **Design Considerations for Custom Functions**: There was a request for a practical example regarding passing custom forward functions to the recipe, highlighting the need for clearer implementation.
  
  - Attention was drawn to ensure compatibility with the **DPO full-finetuning** process in the context of losses not using reference logprobs.
- **SimPO Deprecation Reminders**: The discussion noted the recent decision to deprecate **SimPO**, emphasizing the need to update the documentation accordingly.
  
  - This step is seen as essential for improving clarity and functionality in implementing custom loss designs.

 

**Link mentioned**: [Custom losses redesign in alignment section · Issue #2206 · pytorch/torchtune](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtune/issues/2206): We have passed several iterations speaking about custom contrastive losses in torchtune. The last point in this direction was the deprecation of SimPO #2062 and the prohibition of new custom losses...
