> AI News for 10/15/2024-10/16/2024. We checked 7 subreddits, [**433** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **31** Discords (**228** channels, and **1716** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **218 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

Nvidia's Nemotron has succeeded at consistently getting attention: we covered [Nemotron 340B](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-to-be-named-2748/), [Mistral-Nemo](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-lskjd/), and [Minitron](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-nvidia-minitron-llm-pruning-and/) in recent months.

However yesterday's Nemotron-70B is coming under a bit more scrutiny.

It's a very familiar pattern: new open model release, claims of "we have GPTx/ClaudeY at home", scoring great on slightly unusual but still credible benchmarks, and it can [count r's in strawberry](https://x.com/lacronicadelaIA/status/1846693418560299268).

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/0d5aab99-d8a6-432d-b18a-5705eb4112b2.png?w=960&fit=max)

In this case Nvidia opted to market the performance of their new **Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B** on Arena Hard, AlpacaEval, and MT-Bench, which to be fair are the 3 leading LLM-as-Judge benchmarks. The results look very exciting when presented in a table:

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/406cfd4f-ef58-42fc-96e2-84ce5ffb979d.png?w=960&fit=max)

The model's performance goes down when LMArena's new style control is applied, but that's unremarkable in and of itself. It's more interesting that other standard benchmarks, like [GPQA](https://x.com/nisten/status/1846694482189971939) and [MMLU Pro](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1g4xpj7/comment/ls9ljn2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and [aider](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1g5c42h/llama31nemotron70binstructhf_scored_55_on_aiders/), come in unchanged or worse compared to the base 70B Llama 3.1 model, causing some disappointment among the excited /r/LocalLlama crew.

The truth is likely simply benign: no training on test, but the new [HelpSteer2-Preference dataset](https://x.com/hillbig/status/1846680004928983531) unifying Bradley-Terry and Regression based reward models happens to improve performance on those 3 benchmarks with ~minimal loss in the others. Absent proper LMArena ELOs this would appear to strictly reduce the value of the automated benchmarks and not much else.

The [entropix-sampled version of Nemotron is impressive though](https://x.com/_xjdr/status/1846640821107675618), which is an ongoing developing story we've lightly covered.

**[Sponsored by Zep]** Zep is a low-latency memory layer for AI agents and assistants built on a simple core primitive: a temporal knowledge graph. This is a pretty cool, flexible way to model the changing relationships between complex entities like customers and products. [You can plug it into your agents using their new open-source tool Graphiti](https://shortclick.link/0vx6ml).

> **swyx commentary**: We covered [Zep as a memory layer last week](https://shortclick.link/uu8gwd) and it looks like [Graphiti](https://shortclick.link/0vx6ml) is the workhorse of the temporal knowledge graph memory abstraction. It's notable both that it can autonomously build a knowledge graph for you as you feed in "episodes", but also that it builds on Neo4j under the hood!
