> AI News for 12/4/2024-12/5/2024. We checked 7 subreddits, [**433** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **31** Discords (**206** channels, and **6267** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **627 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

As Sama teased, OpenAI's 12 days of shipmas ([which perhaps includes the Sora API](https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24312352/openai-sora-o1-reasoning-12-days-shipmas) and [perhaps GPT4.5](https://x.com/scaling01/status/1864708868833411188?s=46)) kicked off with the full o1 launch:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBfQTnA2n2s

and the clearest win is that o1 can see now, which [Hyungwon notes makes it the SOTA multimodal model](https://x.com/hwchung27/status/1864764887165272190?s=46):

> `Using Aider Architect Mode, Managing API Keys for Hyperbolic Direct, Aider Composer Integration, Commit Message Generation Failure, Documentation Feeding Tools` 


- **Custom Models and Architect Mode Issues**: Users discussed configuring their own models, like **Marco o1**, within Aider and how to set **architect mode** using `/architect`. It was highlighted that whatever `--model` is in effect will govern the architect's behavior.
   - Moreover, Aider's ability to write outputs directly to files was questioned, as users pointed out its limitation in directly saving content.
- **API Key Configuration for Hyperbolic Direct**: There was a query on how to provide an API key for **Hyperbolic Direct**, with a response directing users to use it as an OpenAI compatible API. Users were directed to the [Aider documentation](https://aider.chat/docs/llms/openai-compat.html) for setup instructions.
   - Steps included setting environment variables and adjusting model prefixes for compatibility.
- **Commit Message Problems Raised**: A user reported that Aider failed to generate a commit message, replacing it with an error message instead, leading to confusion. Another participant explained that this happens when the LLM does not generate a commit message and defaults to saying **(no commit message provided)**.
   - Discussion ensued around whether Aider should prompt for a message instead of defaulting to an empty description, with suggestions to fix it using `git --amend`.
- **Using Aider Composer in VSCode**: Questions were raised about whether existing configurations in **.aider.model.settings.yml** and **.aider.conf.yml** would also be used by Aider Composer in VSCode. Users confirmed the integration would work seamlessly if correctly set up.
   - Configuration specifics for VSCode were shared to clarify usage and functionality across different environments.
- **Feeding Documentation into Aider**: A user inquired about tools to input entire documentation sites into Aider, rather than just single pages in markdown. There was no concrete tool suggested, but the topic highlighted a potential need for this functionality.
