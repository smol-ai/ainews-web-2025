<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->Some Smol Talk meta today: we didn't feel too happy with the "boringness" of the bullet point summaries so we tried to tweak the prompts:

### ‚ñ∑ #[openai-chatter](https://discord.com/channels/974519864045756446/977697652147892304/) (209 messagesüî•üî•): 
        
- **ChatGPT issues on multiple browsers**: Users `@rosyskull` and `@kilogamz` reported issues with ChatGPT on multiple browsers including Opera GX, Firefox, and Edge. Even after clearing cache, using different devices and trying different network connections, the issue persisted. `@satanhashtag` suggested reaching out to `help.openai.com` and also posting in `<#1070006915414900886>` - OpenAI's specific channel for such enquiries.
  
- **ChatGPT information about itself is unreliable**: Users `@lugui` and `@beanz_and_rice` discussed the unreliable nature of ChatGPT when it comes to providing information about itself, specifically its versions, upgrades, and capabilities. It was emphasised that ChatGPT often hallucinates or misrepresents this information. Discussion also clarified the different versions and terminology used in model names.

- **Issues with constant captchas when using VPN**: User `@thedeeplearningdummy` raised an issue of constant captcha verifications whenever they access ChatGPT through a VPN connection. Esteemed theory among discussion is that VPNs can trigger security measures due to cache/IP masking, though the matter remains inconclusive.

- **Issues with AskYourPDF plug-in in GPT+**: User `@kez92.` reported an issue with the plug-in ‚ÄúAskYourPDF‚Äù in GPT+, which ordinarily allows ChatGPT to process PDF files. Problem is, instead of allowing the upload of a PDF, it requests to copy and paste the information or provide a link, which is an abnormal behavior. No resolution was provided in the messages. 

- **Irregular output and rapid usage cap hit with GPT3.5-turbo-1106**: Multiple users reported issues with the `GPT3.5-turbo-1106` model, including `@minister_maximus` who reported receiving gibberish output, and `@Mr Gingerfish` who claimed to have hit the usage cap after just four prompts. Others provided some theories, possible causes, and solutions, but issues appear to be ongoing and unresolved.


### ‚ñ∑ #[openai-questions](https://discord.com/channels/974519864045756446/974519864045756454/) (75 messagesüî•üî•): 
        
- **ChatGPT Inconsistently Nailing Personality Traits**: `@thefreebachelor` and `@solbus` discuss the difficulty of tuning ChatGPT's personality. `@thefreebachelor` mentions that a knowledge file worked well for configuring an AI's profile picture but not its personality, expressing frustration that a long Reddit paragraph caused the model to become messy. `@solbus` suggests starting with a fresh GPT and manually editing the instructions to get closer to the desired outcome.

- **Conversation Limitations with GPT-4**: Users `@crafty.chaos`, `@paulh3911`, and `@darthgustav.` discuss encountering limits to how long a conversation with GPT-4 can be. This question was raised after users reported reaching the error "conversation too long, please start a new one" during their chat session with the AI. 

- **Technical Issues with ChatGPT**: Users `@ssk0746`, `@froggy_chacko`, `@bartomeu_70091_41043`, `@watchalls`, and `@solbus` discuss technical issues they've encountered with the ChatGPT service. Issues include ChatGPT 4.0 not working with certain VPNs and issues with excessive verification puzzles. `@bartomeu_70091_41043`'s issue with the human verification puzzles was temporarily resolved by not using a VPN with Firefox.

- **Usage of ChatGPT in Software Development Work**: User `@muhct` presented a scenario, questioning the best way to use ChatGPT for a software development job without the employer knowing. Suggestions from `@spyied` and `@michael_6138_97508` revolved around using alternative services like GitHub's Copilot and logging responsibilities for proprietary data protection.

- **Quiz on GPT-4's Message Cap Limit**: `@yomo42` queried group members whether "GPT-4 classic" has a higher message cap than regular GPT-4. `@yomo42` added that they had learned the cap for custom GPT versions is 25 messages per 3 hours.

- **Return of missing GPT's**: `@loschess` mentioned that all their missing GPT's have returned and wondered if anyone else experienced the same.


### ‚ñ∑ #[prompt-engineering](https://discord.com/channels/974519864045756446/1046317269069864970/) (169 messagesüî•üî•): 
        
- **GPT-4's Paradoxical "Last Seen" Problem**: `@beanz_and_rice` identifies a paradoxical issue in GPT-4 Preview when asking about the "last time X was seen". The model explained that this issue occurred due to the ambiguity of the term "last," which creates a conflict between the model's instruction to access historical data up until 2023 and the inherent implication of immediacy within the term. This discrepancy resulted in the model providing the most recent information within its established timeframe (pre-2023), which may diverge from the actual "last" occurrence beyond 2023.
- **Various Versions of GPT-4 and Their Features**: The conversation uncovers various aspects of different GPT-4 versions. For example, GPT-4.0613 does not have the same issue with the "last seen" query as GPT-4 Preview does. Furthermore, `@beanz_and_rice` questions whether GPT-4 Turbo incorporates vision and whether GPT-4.1106 is capable of "seeing" images, with `@madame_architect` clarifying that Vision is a skill of GPT-4 Turbo. 
- **GPT-4's Overreliance on Bing**: Some users, particularly `@beanz_and_rice`, express dissatisfaction with GPT-4's tendency to lean on Bing for information retrieval despite its extensively trained dataset. `@madame_architect` rationalizes this behavior by indicating that GPT-4 is trained to use the Bing skill, consequently using real-time data from search results to enhance its responses.
- **Prompt-Engineering for TikTok Scripts and SWOT Analysis**: `@user691378` seeks advice on crafting a prompt for generating funny TikTok scripts with ChatGPT, to which `@beanz_and_rice` offers unique pseudo language. In contrast, `@madame_architect` presents a challenge to create prompts that generate SWOT analyses on technologies, citing superior results when prompting individually for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
- **Challenges and Solutions for Modulating GPT-4's Output**: Both `@MishaMgla` and `@vangroovie` grapple with issues in GPT-4's outputs. `MishaMgla` struggles with the need to limit response lengths without over-engineering the model and incurring extra costs. Acknowledging limitations, `@rendo1` suggests setting token limitations via the API but warns of potential sentence cutoffs. `@vangroovie` reports issues with GPT inaccurately transposing speakers in customer service transcripts.


### ‚ñ∑ #[api-discussions](https://discord.com/channels/974519864045756446/1046317269069864970/) (169 messagesüî•üî•): 
        
- **The Paradox of Last Seen**: User `@beanz_and_rice` unearthed a paradox in **GPT-4-Preview's** response to a query involving the "last time X was seen." The chatbot described it as an ambiguous statement, explaining that as it has historical data up until 2023 but cannot access real-time updates, it doesn't have the capacity to determine the most recent occurrence of any event post-2023.

- **Bing Browsing and Its Role in API**: User `@beanz_and_rice` analyzed that every time "real-time" info is requested, GPT-4-Preview tends to invoke the Bing search skill. `@madame_architect` further clarified that Bing isn't the entire dataset of the Internet, but rather a tool GPT uses to grab necessary data for specific tasks in real-time..

- **Utilizing GPT for Unique Tasks**: User `@user691378` initiated a discussion on force-feeding GPT custom-made scripts in an attempt to generate a funny texting video for TikTok.

- **Techniques for Constructing Effective Prompts**: `@madame_architect` shared her experiences and methods for preparing effective prompts, which included reading numerous AI papers on prompting tactics and indulging in on-hand learning experiments with GPT.

- **Limits of Text Outputs**: `@MishaMgla` voiced concerns about controlling the length and quality of output generated by GPT. They found that keeping the text's length within certain range required the generation of an additional response, thus incurring extra time and costs. Users proposed methods to limit the output length, although some of these methods might cause GPT to cut off text mid-sentence.

- **Flexible Answer Extraction Code Issue Discussed**: @hailey_schoelkopf shared an issue from GitHub titled ["More Flexible Answer Extraction Code"](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/issues/1159). The matter revolves around the current evaluation system which discredits answers that are correct but not in the required format. The issue creates a bias for models that are trained to mimic the benchmark formatting, thus disadvantaging equally capable models with nonstandard formatting.
- **Proposed Solution**: @hailey_schoelkopf suggested a solution to have two evaluation scores for every relevant generative task. The first one (`acc` with `strict` postprocessing/extraction) would follow the original design of the task with precise formatting. The second one (`acc` with `loose/flexible` postprocessing) would attempt to extract the correct answer from the model's generation irrespective of the format. This solution aims to address complaints about tasks where different evaluation frameworks report varying scores due to their flexible answer extraction methodologies. The user has asked for feedback on this proposed solution from the community.
