  **Anthropic** introduced a RAG technique called Contextual Retrieval that
  reduces retrieval failure rates by 67% using prompt caching. **Meta** is
  teasing multimodal capabilities for **Llama 3** ahead of Meta Connect.
  **OpenAI** is hiring for a multi-agent research team working on **o1 models**,
  which require goal-oriented prompting and have sparked debate similar to early
  GPT-3 reactions. Comparisons show **DeepSeek 2.5** is significantly cheaper
  than **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** and **GPT-4**. New models like **3DTopia-XL** use

  image-to-video conversion. Research highlights include a prompting technique
  that boosts reasoning by having LLMs re-read questions. Industry insights
  emphasize the necessity of AI adoption in enterprises and the disruption of
  traditional ML businesses. Tools like **LangChainAI's LangGraph Templates**
  and **LlamaIndex's LlamaParse Premium** enhance agentic applications and

Anthropic wrote about [Contextrual Retrieval](https://www.anthropic.com/news/contextual-retrieval), a RAG technique that takes advantage of their prompt caching feature, showing that Reranked Contextual Embedding and Contextual BM25 reduced the top-20-chunk retrieval failure rate by 67% (5.7% → 1.9%):
