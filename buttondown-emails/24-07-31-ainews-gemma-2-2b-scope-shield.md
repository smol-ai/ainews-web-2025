> - `Intrinsic self-correction in LLMs`
> - `Benchmarking reasoning trajectories`
> - `LLM limitations in reasoning and planning`
> - `Critique of LLM self-correction` 


- **Subbarao Kambhampati critiques LLM reasoning**: In a recent [YouTube episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1WnHpedi2A), Prof. Kambhampati argues that while **LLMs** excel at many tasks, they possess significant limitations in logical reasoning and planning.
   - His [ICML tutorial](https://youtu.be/2DbmSTK2owI?si=mIJ9lFLyxM1RGCjB) delves further into the role of LLMs in planning, supported by various papers on self-correction issues ([Large Language Models Cannot Self-Correct Reasoning Yet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01798)).
- **Challenges in intrinsic self-correction benchmarks**: There are concerns about the feasibility of benchmarks where an LLM has to correct its own reasoning trajectory due to an initial error, possibly making it an unrealistic setup.
   - The discussion highlights the difficulty in comparing model performances when the benchmark involves models intentionally generating faulty trajectories for self-correction.
- **LLMs struggle to self-correct effectively**: Research indicates that **LLMs** often fail to self-correct effectively without external feedback, raising questions about the viability of intrinsic self-correction.
   - A summary of the study on self-verification limitations reveals that models experience **accuracy degradation** during self-verification tasks as opposed to using external verifiers.
- **Feedback loops in LLM reasoning**: A member noted a peculiar aspect of LLM reasoning where an initial mistake could be corrected later due to context changes in the generated output, hinting at potential stochastic influences.
   - This implies that while LLMs might demonstrate some capacity for correction, the reasoning and planning processes could remain fundamentally flawed.
- **Validation and insights on LLM reasoning**: Despite some skepticism about the effectiveness of LLM self-correction, there is appreciation for the ongoing research into benchmarking such capabilities.
   - Participants see value in tracking LLMs’ progress through these benchmarks, suggesting they could be beneficial to understanding reasoning improvements.
