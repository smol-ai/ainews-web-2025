> - `Inference-time computation impacts on LLMs`
> - `StructRAG in knowledge-intensive tasks` 


- **GraphIC transforms ICL selection**: The paper introduces [GraphIC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02203), a technique using graph-based representations and Bayesian Networks (BNs) to enhance the selection of in-context examples (ICEs) for large language models (LLMs). It addresses the limitations of conventional text-based embedding methods in multi-step reasoning tasks.
   - *Graph structures filter out shallow semantics*, preserving deeper reasoning structures necessary for effective multi-step reasoning.
- **Enhancing LLMs via inference-time computation**: Research on [inference-time computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03314) investigates how allowing LLMs to utilize fixed additional compute can boost performance on difficult prompts. The findings highlight important implications for future LLM pretraining and the balance between inference-time and pre-training compute.
   - Current studies reveal that understanding the scaling behaviors of test-time inference methods is critical, though many strategies have shown negative results.
- **StructRAG optimizes retrieval in reasoning tasks**: The paper proposes a new framework called [StructRAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08815) to enhance retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, focusing on better handling of knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks. By converting raw information into structured knowledge, the framework aims to effectively identify needed information.
   - This structured approach can optimize information for various tasks, facilitating improved reasoning amidst the noisy augmentation traditionally faced in existing RAG methods.

- **Gemma 2 Support via Flex Attention**: Members discussed implementing **Gemma 2** using **Flex Attention**, noting that the only blocker is **logit softcapping** which will require an appropriate `score_mod` function to be defined.
   - It's suggested that a **tradeoff** for using Flex is acceptable since it simplifies the process, despite potential reliance on CUDA with high compute capabilities.
- **Logit Softcapping and Flex APIs**: It was noted that while **logit softcapping** isn't directly available with `F.sdpa`, it can be exposed in `_sdpa_or_flex_attention()` through Flex APIs, allowing for its implementation.
   - The discussion highlighted that shifting to **Flex** could allow quicker adaptation for upcoming attention operators in future models.
- **Testing and Implementation Concerns**: Concerns were raised about the **testing** required for Gemma 2 across different model sizes, with a suggestion to crowdsource testing efforts for those with more computational resources.
   - Participants agreed on the importance of ensuring that the **implementation** is robust even if it means relying on a simpler fallback where needed.
- **CUDA Dependency Considerations**: There was a consensus that the implementation of **Gemma 2** via Flex may be limited by requiring **CUDA** with sufficient compute capability, highlighting a gap for non-CUDA users.
   - Members acknowledged that this restriction would allow for more focused efforts to develop the support features needed incrementally.
- **Naive Fallback vs Flex**: A member proposed that having a **`naive_fallback`** could be beneficial to support all functionalities as they emerge, despite the possible overhead in maintenance.
   - Concerns were shared about whether Flex's flexibility might alleviate these maintenance challenges over time.

   - @palebluedot_32091 advised merging the adapter into a new base model before training on additional data.
- **Guide for merging adapters**: When @vortexwault asked for guidance on merging the adapter, @palebluedot_32091 directed them to a [GitHub guide](https://github.com/axolotl-ai-cloud/axolotl?tab=readme-ov-file#merge-lora-to-base).
   - He also indicated that the new training run's config should include the line `base_model: '/path/to/merged/model'`.
- **Follow-up on guidance**: @vortexwault thanked @palebluedot_32091 for the guidance and mentioned he would look into the recommended resource.
   - "Let me check it brother thank you," said @vortexwault, indicating his intent to follow the advice.

> - `Text Completion Training`
> - `Model Specialization`
> - `Overfitting Risks` 


- **Instruct models get optimized with text completion training**: Training an instruct model, such as **GPT-3.5-Instruct**, on a text completion task can significantly improve its performance on instruction-based tasks, resulting in more accurate and contextually relevant completions.
   - *“This can result in improved ability to generate text that aligns closely with prompts.”*
- **Risk of overfitting in narrow training**: There are potential risks of **overfitting** if the training dataset for the text completion task is not diverse or is too small, leading to high performance on familiar data but poor generalization.
   - A caution emphasized was that **performance might degrade** on other tasks not seen during the specific training.
- **Adaptation to new formats and fields**: The training can help the model adapt to new formats or types of instructions that it was not exposed to during its initial training.
   - This adaptation fosters the model's ability to handle a broader range of inputs more effectively.
- **Importance of diverse training datasets**: To achieve optimal outcomes when training instruct models, using a diverse and representative dataset is essential.
   - Monitoring for overfitting and ensuring broad performance evaluation across tasks is crucial for maintaining generalization capabilities.

> - `Multi-turn Examples Evaluation`
> - `Model Performance Metrics`
> - `Modification Restrictions on Base Handler` 


- **Challenges in Multi-Turn Evaluation Process**: Members discussed the evaluation method for multi-turn examples, trying each turn 20 times before concluding an attempt as a fail if the model doesn't output an empty string.
   - A significant issue arises since even with correct predictions, the model cannot break the count loop resulting in a **~0% performance**.
- **Temporary Workaround Improves Performance**: One member noted that modifying the code in base_handler.py to only try once per round leads to an improvement to **~15% performance** in multi-turn evaluations.
   - However, they emphasized that **modifications to base_handler.py are not permitted**, seeking alternative resolutions.
