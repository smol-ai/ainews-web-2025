  **Apple Intelligence** introduces a small (~3 billion parameters) on-device
  model and a larger server model running on Apple Silicon with Private Cloud
  Compute. Apple employs a novel **lossless quantization** strategy using mixed
  2-bit and 4-bit LoRA adapters averaging 3.5 bits-per-weight, enabling
  efficient hot-swapping of adapters and low latency (0.6 ms per token) on
  iPhone 15 Pro. The **Talaria** tool profiles model architectures and
  quantization under resource budgets. Apple focuses on an "adapter for
  everything" approach with initial support for SiriKit and App Intents,
  emphasizing practical consumer performance over academic benchmarks. The Apple
  ML blog also mentions an Xcode code model and a diffusion model for Genmoji.

<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->**Apple Intelligence is all you need.**

> AI News for 6/7/2024-6/10/2024. We checked 7 subreddits, [**384** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **30** Discords (**411** channels, and **7641** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **816 minutes**.

With [Apple Intelligence](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/introducing-apple-intelligence-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/), Apple has claimed to leapfrog Google Gemma, Mistral Mixtral, Microsoft Phi, and Mosaic DBRX in one go, with a small "Apple On-Device" model (~3b parameters) and a "larger" Apple Server model (available with [Private Cloud Compute](https://security.apple.com/blog/private-cloud-compute/) running on Apple Silicon).

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_EYoV1kZWk

The [Apple ML blogpost](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/introducing-apple-foundation-models) also briefly mentioned two other models - an Xcode code-focused model, and a diffusion model for Genmoji.

What appears to be underrated is the on-device model's hot-swapping LoRAs with **apparently lossless quantization** strategy:

> For on-device inference, we use low-bit palletization, a critical optimization technique that achieves the necessary memory, power, and performance requirements. To maintain model quality, **we developed a new framework using LoRA adapters that incorporates a mixed 2-bit and 4-bit configuration strategy — averaging 3.5 bits-per-weight — to achieve the same accuracy as the uncompressed models.**
> 
> Additionally, we use an interactive model latency and power analysis tool, Talaria, to better guide the bit rate selection for each operation. We also utilize activation quantization and embedding quantization, and have developed an approach to enable efficient Key-Value (KV) cache update on our neural engines.
> 
> With this set of optimizations, **on iPhone 15 Pro we are able to reach time-to-first-token latency of about 0.6 millisecond per prompt token, and a generation rate of 30 tokens per second.** Notably, this performance is attained before employing token speculation techniques, from which we see further enhancement on the token generation rate.
> 
> We represent the values of the adapter parameters using 16 bits, and for the ~3 billion parameter on-device model, the parameters for a rank 16 adapter typically require 10s of megabytes. **The adapter models can be dynamically loaded, temporarily cached in memory, and swapped** — giving our foundation model the ability to specialize itself on the fly for the task at hand while efficiently managing memory and guaranteeing the operating system's responsiveness.

The key tool they are crediting for this incredible on-device inference is [Talaria](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/talaria):

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/3da01ba6-e217-4d24-bd5c-43d84982c6b3.png?w=960&fit=max) 

Talaria helps to ablate quantizations and profile model architectures subject to budgets:

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/63f0a6dc-7388-412a-9d00-9222d8cb7316.png?w=960&fit=max) 

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/f01e9b2f-0d1a-4f70-99cf-8621c5ea7425.png?w=960&fit=max) 

Far from a God Model, Apple seems to be pursuing an "adapter for everything" strategy and Talaria is set to make it easy to rapidly iterate and track the performance of individual architectures. This is why Craig Federighi announced that Apple Intelligence only specifically applies to a specific set of 8 adapters for SiriKit and 12 categories of App Intents to start with:
 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/518032f7-20cc-47ae-a188-211dbdad4e58.png?w=960&fit=max) 
 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/87f3022a-4d51-4df3-8a6f-10997e6088e1.png?w=960&fit=max) 

Knowing that Apple designs for a strict inference budget, it's also interesting to see how Apple self-reports performance. Virtually all the results (except instruction following) are done with human graders, which has the advantage of being the gold standard yet the most opaque:

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/27af4622-10b9-4c07-830c-649c9fb11a00.png?w=960&fit=max) 

The sole source of credibility of these benchmarks claiming to beat Google/Microsoft/Mistral/Mosaic is that Apple does not need to win in the academic arena - it merely needs to be "good enough" to the consumer to win. Here, it only has to beat the low bar of Siri circa 2011-2023.

- **Dynamic Sequence Generation with σ-GPT**: A new method, σ-GPT, introduces on-the-fly dynamic sequence generation by adding a positional encoding for outputs, enabling sampling and conditioning on arbitrary token subsets. This dramatically reduces the number of model evaluations across various domains, such as language modeling and path-solving ([Read more](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09562)).
- **Alternative to Autoregressive Models**: While σ-GPT shows impressive results, members raised concerns about its practical application due to the required curriculum for high performance, drawing parallels to XLNET which did not gain traction ([Twitter discussion](https://x.com/ArnaudPannatier/status/1799055129829839166)).
- **Transformer Embedding Analysis**: There are inquiries regarding the nature of learned embeddings in transformers, comparing discrete and continuous representations. References to a [2019 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09418) provided insights into how attention heads contribute to model performance and can be pruned dramatically with minimal loss.
- **Prompt-Based Reasoning Challenges**: Shared a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cpldcpu/MisguidedAttention) containing prompts that challenge LLMs' reasoning abilities, revealing that model failure often stems from overrepresented problems in training data.
- **Condition Embedding Perturbation Testing**: Experimentation with condition embedding perturbation showed that applying Gaussian noise (at various gamma levels) influenced the model's adherence to prompts, with notable results at higher gamma settings ([Experimental results](https://x.com/panopstor/status/1798481967391945186)).

- **Leveraging Pre-trained Instruct Models**: A member suggested using previously trained instruct models with coding capabilities for a project, by increasing their context window and feeding them Rust documentation. They noted that a Google scientist recommended this approach over training from scratch.
- **Generic Error Message Troubleshooting**: A member explained that a generic error message in a websocket could be due to various issues such as reinstalling websocket or how the model handles operations. They advised providing debugging console output, running separate test code, and writing test cases to identify the problem.
- **Websocket Audio Response Lag**: One member described the behavior of a Text-to-Speech (TTS) service websocket, noting that after the first browser refresh, the websocket receives a 1001 going away signal and manifests a lag where audio packets are delayed by one turn. This lag worsens after subsequent refreshes, with audio packets then being delayed by multiple turns, despite other websockets in the same container functioning correctly.

- **Adjust Learning Rate When Altering Epochs**: When changing the number of epochs, reduce the learning rate by the same factor to maintain the same learning per data sample. This compensates for the increased number of updates.
- **Micro_batch_size and Gradient_accumulation_steps Impact**: Effective batch size is crucial; if it changes, adjust the learning rate accordingly. The common practice is to scale the learning rate linearly with batch size changes as per guidelines from [Hugging Face](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate/tree/main/docs/source/concept_guides/performance.md#L75L99).
- **Adjust for Number of GPUs**: Increase in GPUs should be matched with a proportional increase in learning rate due to the effective batch size growth. This guideline helps achieve stability and efficiency in training.
- **Clarification Sought on Inconsistencies**: A user pointed out the inconsistency in Phorm's initial advice concerning gradient_accumulation_steps and effective batch size. They requested the correct approach be confirmed and sourced properly.

- **Convex architecture explains unique game loop**: The game loop runs in Convex, executing as a series of short-lived serverless functions. This differs from traditional games where the game state is kept in-memory and everything runs on the same machine.
- **Scalability via distributed functions**: The setup allows handling numerous API calls and inputs because the game’s aspects are managed by independent serverless function calls. This means convex's backend can scale efficiently.
- **Client updates via websocket subscriptions**: The client subscribes to a query through a websocket, receiving push updates whenever there are changes. This is one of the beneficial features provided by Convex.
- **Challenges for multiplayer scenarios**: Due to varying network latencies among players, competitive play isn't optimal. This aspect was highlighted to explain the limitations for real-time interactions in a multi-user environment.
- **Deep dive into AI Town architecture**: For CS studies, it is recommended to review [AI Town's Architecture document](https://github.com/a16z-infra/ai-town/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md) for a comprehensive understanding of the inner workings.
