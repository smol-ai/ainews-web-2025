- **Model Deprecation Confusion**: The `sonar-medium-online` model was expected to be deprecated on March 15, but users have observed that it is still functional and not just rerouting to alternative models. There has been speculation about whether the deprecation comes into effect at the end of the day or if plans have changed.
- **API Giveth and API Taketh Away**: When using `sonar-medium-online`, one user found inconsistencies between news pulled via the web browser versus the API, highlighting differing responses regarding recent news about Donald Trump.
- **Quest for Links in the Job Market Jungle**: A user was trying to use the Perplexity API to get specific job posting links. It's noted that while occasionally the API provides actual job position links, other times it only returns links to job search platforms like LinkedIn or Glassdoor.
- **Dancing with Tokens ‚Äì Max or Min?**: There was a discussion about how setting the `maxtokens` parameter affects the API's response. The consensus reveals that if set too low, the API may provide incomplete responses; if too high, it might not utilize the available space, suggesting the model does not "fill" extra space but focuses on complete responses.
- **Seeking Sources & Citations**: A conversation regarding URL citations confirms that feature is still in beta, linking to an application form for those interested. Additionally, current API access for 'Pro' users to URL citations from the closed beta was discussed, and users shared links for the application and discussions on model performance comparisons.

**Unsloth AI (Daniel Han) ‚ñ∑ #[general](https://discord.com/channels/1179035537009545276/1179035537529643040/1218108656428650526)** (853 messagesüî•üî•üî•): 

- **Grok 1: The Behemoth Unleashed**: Elon Musk's release of **Grok 1**, a 314 billion parameter Mixture-of-Experts model, has sparked discussions due to its size and impracticality for most users. The model was anticipated to be undertrained, with performance slightly below Miqu, slightly above Llama2 70b, and on par with Mixtral.

- **Hyperparameters for QLoRA**: The preferred hyperparameters for fine-tuning **QLoRA** on Mistral-7b seem to be a learning rate of `2e-4` and up to 3 epochs, as suggested in Unsloth's notebooks. However, users are encouraged to adjust these settings according to specific tasks and datasets.

- **Impersonation Alert in Discord**: Users reported a scam account pretending to be **Daniel Han** (`starsupernova`) on Discord. Reports to Discord have been filed, and users are cautioned to be wary of friend requests from the impersonator and report if encountered.

- **New Tools and Integrations**: AIKit introduced an integration for fine-tuning with **Unsloth**, providing users the ability to fine-tune language models with a config file and create OpenAI compatible model images using Docker. WandB (Weights & Biases) has been suggested for monitoring and visualizing training data.

- **Understanding Quantization**: There's a continued interest in understanding quantization for language models. A 4-bit BnB quantization reduces model sizes by reducing the bits per weight, but resources for learning about quantization were requested. Fine-tuning guidelines and dataset structuring for instruction tuning were also sought after by community members.

**Unsloth AI (Daniel Han) ‚ñ∑ #[help](https://discord.com/channels/1179035537009545276/1179777624986357780/1218104575022727230)** (568 messagesüî•üî•üî•): 

- **Dealing with VRAM demands during model saving**: A user noticed high VRAM usage during the saving process, in addition to VRAM used to load the model. Saving on a machine with 8GB VRAM for a 7b Mistral bnb 4bit model led to crashes, indicating that adequate VRAM plus additional system RAM is necessary for successful model saving.

- **VRAM clearing during model saving may not help**: When suggested to restart the computer to clear VRAM as a solution for crashes during model saving, it was clarified that the model needs to be loaded into VRAM for saving, hence restarting does not suffice.

- **Colab resources for training and saving models**: A user successfully ran code in Colab after failing initially, emphasizing the luck element in gaining enough resources on the platform.

- **Differences between models saved in Colab vs. local machines**: 8GB VRAM appears suitable for running the 7b Mistral bnb 4bit model, highlighting a discrepancy between VRAM requirements for operating in Colab versus local setups.

- **Targeting model merging tactics**: A suggestion was made to apply tactics used when merging UltraChat with base Mistral to Mistral-Yarn, with discussions implying a mix of skepticism and optimism based on previous experiences with model merging approaches.

- **Evolving RAG Capabilities**: Members discussed potential features and improvements to enhance RAG models, mentioning properties such as response modes that switch from verbose to structured output, citation and span highlighting, and the ability to understand intent and decomposition. High recall and relevance ranking were also mentioned, but it was noted that some LLMs experience challenges in reasoning with long external contexts.
- **RAG Model Context and Functionality**: There was debate over how a RAG model should balance using provided external context and its own knowledge, with suggestions for "modes" allowing the model to focus solely on external sources or to extrapolate with internal knowledge when prompted. The idea of training models to be able to call functions and break down complex extraction tasks was also floated.
- **Output Formatting for RAG Responses**: There is a consensus that while markdown might not need to be the default output format, outputs should incorporate structured elements like lists, tables, and code, and maintain good practices in citation. The conversation included mentioning the utility of [Cohere's model](https://cohere.ai/docs) which includes inline citations in its responses.
- **Potential Uses for Specialized Smaller Models in RAG Pipelines**: A proposition was made to train specialized, smaller models to enhance RAG pipeline efficiency, such as a dedicated "relevant info extractor" model. A concern was expressed that larger models might not be as optimal for real-time RAG operations due to latency issues.

- **Query on Sampling Strings from a Specified Distribution**: A member inquired if there is a canonical way to sample strings from a pre-specified set of 1-gram, 2-gram, ..., n-gram statistics on a vocabulary.
  
- **Constraint Hierarchy in Gram Statistics**: It was clarified that specifying n-gram statistics also determines the statistics of all lower-order grams, albeit with some minor considerations for beginning-of-sentence (BOS) and end-of-sentence (EOS) tokens.

- **Autoregressive Sampling Explained**: Autoregressive sampling is the method to use for drawing samples from a distribution matching specified n-gram statistics. This approach starts with unigram distribution, then proceeds with conditional bigram distribution, etc., thereby creating the max entropy distribution that corresponds to those specified statistics.

- **N-gram Language Models Background**: The discussion included a reference to the [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_n-gram_language_model) on word n-gram language models, highlighting their historical context and their replacement by more advanced models like recurrent neural networks and large language models.

- **Understanding Yann's Stance on LLMs**: A series of discussions highlighted a tweet from @Teknium1 regarding Yann LeCun's bearish view on large language models (LLMs). It was mentioned that Yann might favor models with visual reasoning or planning capabilities over purely language-based models, based on the hypothesis some individuals inherently lack an internal monologue, possibly influencing their preference for non-linguistic thought processes. An interview with an individual who also lacks an inner monologue was shared. Members questioned the dichotomy between 'shape rotators' and 'wordcels' in cognitive reasoning.
- **OpenAI's GTC Virtual Sessions Offer**: Members discussed OpenAI's GTC (GPU Technology Conference) attendance, sharing free access codes to virtual sessions and hinting at a potential hardware exchange program for influencers who help with sign-ups. The registration link was provided along with access to session details.
- **Releasing Grok-1: Huge Model with Uncertain Impact**: xAI announced the open release of Grok-1, a 314 billion parameter Mixture-of-Experts model, hoping for community contributions in continued training and evaluation. The community reaction was mixed, with some expressing concern over its quality compared to other models like LLaMa and Claude, while appreciating the scale of the model. Discussions revolved around the potential of continual pretraining and quantization to improve or utilize the model.
- **SWYX on Lex Podcast's Missed Opportunities**: The Lex Fridman podcast featuring Sam Altman received criticism for not delving into more substantial issues and glossing over the inner workings and politics at OpenAI. Listeners found the conversation lacking in depth, focusing more on tangential topics and less on providing insights into AI and model advancements.
- **Jensen Huang's Nvidia Keynote Expectations**: There was anticipation for Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's GTC keynote, with speculations on the potential reveal of significant parameters for AI advancements. While no direct quotes confirm it, the community seemed to accept the 1.8 trillion parameter reveal for GPT-4 during the presentation.
