> `Codeium Pro issues and snoozing, Supercomplete availability in Codeium, Visual Studio Codeium extension versions, JetBrains extension issues` 


- **Codeium Pro users face snoozing problems**: A user reported that **Codeium Pro** stops working and snoozes itself, requiring manual re-enablement, which is a known issue for some users.
   - The user found that using the **pre-release version** of the extension provided a better experience, though still not ideal.
- **Supercomplete's Status Clarified**: **Supercomplete**, initially marketed for Pro plans, is now included in the free plan but functions fully only in the pre-release version of the extension due to API issues caused by Microsoft.
   - One user noted that they wished to be notified of such changes.
- **Visual Studio Version Lags**: A user noted that the **Visual Studio version** of the extension provides inferior suggestions compared to the **VSCode version**.
   - It was revealed that the **Visual Studio extension** uses an older Codeium LSP, with a link to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Exafunction/CodeiumVisualStudio) provided for reference.
- **JetBrains Plugin stuck on Processing request**: Users of the **JetBrains plugin** reported being stuck in the *Processing request* phase, leading to errors.
   - This problem occurs specifically in the latest pre-release version, causing the plugin to be unable to generate responses.
- **Enterprise features lagging behind Windsurf**: A member mentioned that **Enterprise** features are lagging the other subscription types.
   - Another member countered that **Enterprise** and **Team** plans have the same cadence and that this is done to ship only *totally battle-tested features*.

> `Codeium customer support, Premium flow action credits, Windsurf's new update, Claude 3.7, Multiple selection using CTRL+D` 


- **Users Experience Poor Codeium Customer Support**: Users have reported experiencing poor customer support from **Codeium**, with one user mentioning they have been trying to follow up with their **subscription issue** for the last 4 weeks without a resolution.
- **Premium Flow Action Credits Depleting Rapidly**: Users reported that their **premium flow action credits** are depleting rapidly, within 4-5 days, even though they still have prompt credits left, and some users are now considering switching to **Cursor**.
   - One user speculated that changes to **Claude 3.7** might be the cause, as it now uses flow actions per prompt, leading to high credit consumption.
- **Windsurf's New Update Causing Issues on Ubuntu**: A recent **Windsurf update** caused issues for users on **Ubuntu 24.04**, with the application failing to start and displaying a **FATAL:setuid_sandbox_host.cc(158)** error, requiring a manual fix to change the permissions of **chrome-sandbox**.
   - One user reported that the update crashed their Ubuntu system, leading to a reinstallation and data loss, highlighting the need for proper backups before updating.
- **Claude 3.7 Code Model Credit Consumption Rate Sparks Debate**: Members observed that **Claude 3.7** is consuming credits rapidly due to excessive tool calls per prompt, with some experiencing **30-40 tool calls** for small changes, also the implementation of **3.7** was too hasty.
   - Some users are now sticking with **3.5** or other models for better efficiency, and there are strong suggestions by users for Codeium to hide **3.7** as a default model.
- **Windsurf struggles to move cursor using CTRL+D**: A user reported an issue with **multiple selection using CTRL+D** in Windsurf, where moving the cursor with **CTRL + Left** or **CTRL + SHIFT + Left** only moves the cursor at the first selection.
   - It was recommended to check the status bar to confirm if you are in multi-selection mode, and it was found out that **the multiple selections disappears from status bar**.

> `Mirror sites with pro accounts, GPT-4.5 Image Recognition, GPT prioritization of Pro vs Plus, Switching from ChatGPT to Grok, Gemini Free vs Pro Features` 


- **Mirror Sites Offer Pro Accounts for Free**: Multiple **mirror sites** offer **pro accounts** for very cheap or free, and haven't been banned, instead OpenAI is shadow banning Plus users who used the service on multiple devices according to [drinkoblog.weebly.com](https://drinkoblog.weebly.com).
   - The same user noted the realistic compute limits, arguing *unlimited sounds better than '12 hours compute'* on the surface, but is unrealistic in practice since some users *never touch grass* and will consume disproportionately more resources.
- **GPT-4.5 Image Recognition Draws Mixed Reactions**: Members are debating whether the new **GPT-4.5** has better **image recognition** compared to GPT-4o, with [Future Machine](https://futuremachine.io) being more vocal about OpenAI (OAI)'s choices, though initial tests show that **GPT-4.5** scores a bit higher than 4o on the MMMU (vision oriented reasoning benchmark) with a **+5% improvement**.
   - One member expressed how they felt they were deprioritizing plus users in favour of pro users, stating that plus now *feels like second class citizens instead of the usual premium status*.
- **Grok's Custom Instructions Released, Not Working For All**: [Grok AI's custom instructions](https://www.thetechoutlook.com/news/web-social-media/new-custom-instructions-feature-added-for-x-platforms-grok-ai-on-web/) feature has been released for all users according to a news source, allowing users to customize Grok as per their needs and make it respond accordingly.
   - A member shared custom Grok instructions aiming for an *abusive and lewd troll* persona, but reported it *doesn't work*, and other users reported the same.
- **GPT pro or Grok Super**: Users discuss the pros and cons of switching from **ChatGPT Pro** to **SuperGrok** with Grok being much faster, smarter for general tasks and some API with outdated info.
   - A user claimed that **Gemini’s** context window has **1 million tokens**, no filter and great for creative writing.
- **Dynamic learning system prototype**: A user is developing a basic application prototype and will try injecting stellargraph nodes into it to create a learning system where they can inject the most relevant information to the AI dynamically, injecting knowledge in it.

> `GPT Model Selection, Projects vs GPTs, Claude 3.7 vs ChatGPT, Context window size comparison, Clearing Chatlogs and Uploaded Data` 


- **Can't Choose Specific Model in GPT Creation**: A user inquired about selecting a specific model when creating a GPT, but was told it defaults to **4o** and you can't choose models in **GPTs**.
   - A user stated you can use the **Projects** feature to change models to **4o, o1, 4.5** in a single chat.
- **Projects Outshines GPTs by Allowing Model Selection**: One user found that while they got the best programming results using **03-mini-high**, custom instructions in **Projects** don't work with **o3 mini** models (only file uploads).
   - However, another user said that with a Pro subscription, using a combination of **o1, 4o, and 4.5** in **Projects** allows for custom instructions with file uploads.
- **ChatGPT Bashed, Claude 3.7 Hailed**: One user declared *ChatGPT is a joke now* and found **Claude 3.7** to be *very impressive*.
   - However, another user said **Claude's** projects are of no use, complaining that they can *hardly upload only two files maximum* and it says *memory full*, calling Claude *over hyped*.
- **Context Windows Compared between Models**: A user touted that **Claude** can better understand the context in larger files, and pointed out its larger context window: **200K** compared to **ChatGPT's 128K**.

- **Dall-E Generates Synthetic Plants with Transplant Organs**: A member prompted **Dall-E** to generate an image of *synthetic plants that grow hearts and livers for transplant*, visible within a transparent membrane and nourished by the GM plant.
   - The initial results emphasized hearts over livers, prompting the user to refine the prompt with more details about the **liver lobes**.
- **Crafting Detailed Prompts for Specific Dall-E Outputs**: The model suggested basing the image on **bioengineered plant-inspired organs** with a focus on **livers and hearts** after an initial image couldn't be shown.
   - The user iteratively refined the prompt to guide **Dall-E's attention** to specific features like liver lobes and the organs forming almost like fruit.
- **Showcasing Art and Following Community Guidelines**: A member shared art prompts, noting the need to **spoiler unsettling or horror-based images** as per community guidelines in <#1107255707314704505>.

- **Llama Zips WAVs into Headaches**: A member had a funny experience with a **llama** model: compressing a **192 KB ZIP file** resulted in a **48 KB lossless WAV format**, which it then tried to re-zip.
   - The user noted, *"confusion, after first working through packing a 48KB again, to make a smaller zip… That was the r1-1776-distill-llama-70b.*"
- **GRPO Training Steps Speculation**: A user inquired about the number of training steps needed for **LoRA training Qwen2.5-14B-instruct** with **GRPO** to lower the loss, wondering if more steps are required for better reasoning.
   - Another member suggested **GRPO** training might take around **24 hours**, stating that convergence depends on the model and sampling, so there's *no fixed time*.
- **Saving 4-Bit Models into Trouble**: A user ran into issues while saving a **Phi-4 model** in **4-bit** after training it with **GRPO**, using an example **Jupyter notebook provided by Unsloth**.
   - The error occurred during the saving process.
- **Unsloth's Docs Teach Checkpointing**: A user inquired about loading **LoRA weights from a previous run**, to which another user pointed to the [Unsloth documentation on finetuning from the last checkpoint](https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/finetuning-from-last-checkpoint).
   - The documentation explains how to edit the Trainer to add *save_strategy* and *save_steps* in order to save checkpoints and resume training.
- **Unsloth Continued Pretraining is Very Helpful for New Languages**: When a user asked about scenarios for continued pre-training, another user linked to the [Unsloth documentation](https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/continued-pretraining), stating it's useful for new languages.
   - The member pointed out that the [blog post](https://unsloth.ai/blog/contpretraining) is even better, explaining how Unsloth's release allows you to easily continually pretrain **LLMs 2x faster** and use **50% less VRAM** than Hugging Face + Flash Attention 2 QLoRA.

- **Github Repo Issues Reported**: A member reported issues with reading [open repos](https://github.com/shawntan/stickbreaking-attention/blob/main/stickbreaking_attention/sb_varlen/softplus.py).
   - They found some code with the `inline_asm` feature.
- **Unsloth uses VLLM for backend**: A member asked how **Unsloth** works in production deployment and was told it uses **VLLM** for the backend.
   - The process involves **GRPO fine-tuning**, then inferencing on the fine-tuned model using **Unsloth + VLLM**, rather than Continuous Training + Inference (online learning).
- **Online training requires implementation**: A member clarified that during **GRPO fine-tuning**, **VLLM** is used to generate and grade outputs with reward functions before backpropagating loss.
   - To implement online training, one would need to develop the mechanism themselves.

> `GRPO Training, Qwen2.5-14B-instruct fine-tuning, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B error, Mistral embedding model, GCC compiler issue` 


- **GRPO Training needs adequate steps**: A member inquired about the number of training steps needed for **LoRA** training **Qwen2.5-14B-instruct** with **GRPO** to lower the loss.
   - Another member suggested that **700-1200 steps** are generally good for training a **GRPO** model using **LoRA**, but the optimal number depends on the dataset.
- **DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B error**: A user encountered a **RuntimeError** when training **unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B** on Kaggle, related to matrix multiplication shapes.
   - Despite upgrading transformers with `pip install --upgrade "git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git"`, the issue persisted, and the user sought advice on resolving it.
- **Mistral Embedding Model missing lm_head**: A user is trying to create an embedding model using **Mistral** but is facing issues with removing the **lmhead** for training.
   - The user is seeking suggestions on how to properly remove the **lmhead** for effective training of the embedding model.
- **Fixing GCC Compiler Issue with vLLM**: A user encountered a **RuntimeError: Failed to find C compiler** when running the **GRPO** tutorial locally with **meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct**.
   - Despite attempting to install **GCC** via **conda**, the issue remained unresolved, and the user is restricted from using **apt-get** due to security reasons on their school's HPC.
- **Decoding GGUF models naming convention**: A user inquired about the naming convention for **GGUF** models, specifically the meaning of the **UD** prefix in models like [unsloth/r1-1776-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/r1-1776-GGUF/tree/main).
   - A member explained that **UD** stands for *Unsloth Dynamics*, a quantization algorithm that provides better results than IQ.

> `GRPO Reward Functions, Distilling Models for Agent Skeletons, SWE-bench Performance, String Replacement for Code Editing, Model Tool-Calling and Composition` 


- **GRPO Rewards Linearly**: Reward functions for GRPO are scored using the same format as in Unsloth's script, with correctness measured by linear scaling based on matches between the extracted answer and the correct answer, using `sum(i == j for i,j in zip(r,a))/len(a)`.
   - The creator noted that GRPO works even without a language prior, leading to better exploration and varied reasoning traces during training.
- **Vladrad cracks Distilling Agent Skeletons**: A member shared a model distilled from O3/R1, designed to generate good agent skeletons from pre-made functions, available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/blog/vkerkez/gitvac), after investing $400 to get the string replacement right.
   - This approach aims to create a base model capable of handling languages that base models struggle with, such as Perl, by incorporating unit tests and problem-solving strategies from other repos.
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet Sweeps Bench with SOTA**: Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieves **49%** on [SWE-bench Verified](https://www.anthropic.com/research/swe-bench-sonnet), surpassing the previous state-of-the-art model's **45%**; they assess a model's ability to complete real-world software engineering tasks by resolving GitHub issues from popular open-source Python repositories.
   - A member referred to the [bitter lesson](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html): *general methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective*.
- **String Replace Debated as Coding Strategy**: Members debated the effectiveness of string replacement for code editing, with one member arguing it's generally *garbage* because models aren't meant to write code this way.
   - Despite reservations, another member reported success fine-tuning Qwen 2.5 for string replacement, especially when the model can see the file before making replacements.
- **New Algorithm: Reinforce++ enhances stability**: A new algorithm, [Reinforce++](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03262v1), claims to improve stability over the classic REINFORCE algorithm by incorporating elements from PPO, calculating advantage with A_t = r(s_t, a_t) - Beta * sum(KL divergence_t->T).
   - The algorithm is said to be similarly performant to GRPO in terms of reward and speed but with greater stability during training.

> `Gradio, Groovy, Python to Javascript` 


- **Gradio kicks off Groovy: Python gets Javascript!**: Gradio introduces **Groovy**, a tool that **converts Python functions to JavaScript** for client-side execution in Gradio apps, enabling developers to write code once in Python and achieve JavaScript performance without the burden of maintaining dual codebases ([docs](https://www.gradio.app/guides/client-side-functions)).
- **Groovy Transpiler Promises Clarity**: Unlike other transpilers, **Groovy** is designed to provide clear error messages when it cannot transpile specific code, focusing on supported elements such as simple Python functions, a subset of the Python standard library, and Gradio-specific classes.
   - This approach ensures developers are aware of limitations when crossing languages, prioritizing transparency over attempting to handle all possible scenarios.
- **Client-Side Functions Boost Gradio Responsiveness**: Gradio allows you to run certain "simple" functions directly in the browser by setting `js=True` in your event listeners, which will **automatically convert your Python code into JavaScript**.
   - This improves app responsiveness by avoiding server round trips, especially beneficial on hosted applications with high load or latency.

- **Aider Leaderboard Tooling Benchmarks**: The Aider leaderboard is used to benchmark AI models while using Aider as the primary tool/assistant; Claude Code is recognized as a tool/assistant rather than an AI model and is also benchmarked.
   - A user pointed out the need for a tool-agnostic benchmark like SWE Benchlets for comparison.
- **Anon-Kode forks Claude Code, goes OpenAI Compatible**: A member shared that the dude who grabbed the source for Claude Code ([link to original tweet](https://x.com/dnak0v/status/1894254049802744188)) has now released a modified version that works with OpenAI compatible APIs ([link to tweet](https://x.com/dnak0v/status/1896652107857748086)) and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/dnakov/anon-kode).
- **Set up Aider in personal project**: A user asked for advice about using Aider with a personal project's Git repository and virtual environment.
   - Others suggested installing Aider globally or in the project's venv and using tools like uv to sync environments.
- **Grok Debugging > O3 Mini Code Creation?**: A user mentioned Grok is good at debugging, but O3 mini high sonnet might be better at code creation, like adding new functions.
   - They also noted Claude 3.7 adds unintended stuff and deepseek-chat with O1 Pro has been almost 95% fine for them as an editor.
- **LLMs Censorship**: Some members discuss the increased censorship in language models, particularly regarding kernel-level code generation and the need to label prompts as "educational only" to bypass restrictions.
   - Grok3 seems to refuse to do the request, guess there still are limits.

- **`gemini/gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05` RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED issues**: A user reported encountering `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` errors when using the `gemini/gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05` model with a large context window in Aider, while the `gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-01-21` model works fine.
   - They asked if there's a way to use the Pro model with a full context window without limits.
- **User solved the problem with Aider Extension using `workon` command.**: A user created an Aider extension with a new `/workon` command, which analyzes imports in a file and passes a list of relevant files to the `add` command.
   - The user claims it saves a lot of time and they have implementations for TS, Vue, Kotlin, and Java, but it's described as *rather ugly* and doesn't support `--subtree-only`.
- **Requesting Aider edit files with Git Diff Syntax**: A user wants Aider to edit files using **git diff syntax** (like `<<<<<< branch`, `======`, `>>>>>>> replace`) directly in the file, instead of just showing it in the terminal and replacing the text.
   - They want to be able to edit the changes before accepting them, but others pointed out this is not possible without forking the project, also you can use built-in IDE diff tool.
- **Sonnet vs OpenRouter recommendation for Aider**: A user requested recommendations for models to use with Aider's edit modes that aren't too expensive, finding **o1-preview** to be both costly and ineffective.
   - Another user suggested using `r1-free` or `gemini flash thinking` for planning and `Sonnet 3.7` for execution and shared a [snippet of their aider config](https://example.com/aider.conf) with model aliases and settings for edit formats.
- **Git commands for Aider**: A user described a technique of creating a script to run Aider, using `--load` to load a script with commands on startup, and adding `/run git diff` to update on the latest changes, useful for working on a branch.
   - A separate user suggests Aider could use `git apply mypatch.diff` to apply changes instead of having the LLM manually edit the whole file and add a `--check` step.

> `SRAM vs Cache Confusion, Triton Scalar Constants Data Type, CUDA backend hyper-parameters, Triton Autotuning Resources, Triton BLAS Implementations` 


- **SRAM and Cache Clarifications**: A discussion clarified the relationship between **SRAM**, **registers**, **shared memory**, and **cache**, noting that registers, shared memory, and cache are chip/software level properties built from SRAM.
   - Any shared memory that isn't allocated actually becomes **L1 cache**.
- **Cache Level Control in Triton**: It was discussed that while Triton doesn't offer direct control over cache levels (**L1/L2**), the `cache_modifier` argument in `tl.load` allows specifying whether to hit from L1 or L2.
   - The difference between `ca` and `cg` is that `cg` specifies that the load should only hit from **L2** and not **L1** cache.
- **CUDA Cache Coherency Deep Dive**: The CUDA documentation states that global data is coherent at the **L2** level, but multiple **L1** caches are not coherent for global data.
   - It was explained that L2 cache is shared among all SMs, but each SM has its own independent L1 cache and that a threadfence can be used to flush L1 cache writes to global memory.
- **Scalar Constants Data Types in Triton**: A user asked about specifying the data type of scalar constants in Triton to avoid unintended upcasting during operations like bitwise AND.
   - Another user suggested to apply mask and then downcast it again to int8 `x=(x&mask).to(tl.int8)`.
- **Block Scaled Matmul for INT8 in Triton**: A user sought guidance on implementing block scaled matrix multiplication for INT8 in Triton, referencing [a tutorial for FP4 and FP8 formats](https://triton-lang.org/main/getting-started/tutorials/10-block-scaled-matmul.html).
   - The user encountered errors with `tl.dot` when attempting to apply scales due to hidden dimension requirements and sought advice on handling the `scales` part.

- **Users seek flexible FSDP2 OffloadPolicy**: A user inquired about plans for **FSDP2** `OffloadPolicy` classes, seeking greater control over gradient handling, specifically to *reduce and not scatter*.
   - The response indicated no immediate plans but suggested exploring `register_post_accumuate_grad_hook`, though this runs after reduce scatter, which the user wants to avoid.
- **CUDA Kernel launch gives illegal memory access**: A user reported issues with **illegal memory access errors** when passing memory pointers directly to CUDA code using `load_inline`.
   - Another user suggested that the **PyTorch CUDA caching allocator** might allocate more memory than needed, potentially causing out-of-bounds reads in the direct pointer version while the tensor version works due to bounds checking.
- **Exploring All-Reduce for Gradient Aggregation**: A user proposed an alternative approach of using **All-Reduce** to aggregate gradients, followed by immediate optimizer application and zeroing of gradients, to avoid offloading.
   - A respondent questioned the scalability of this approach due to the **2x communication volume** compared to reduce-scatter, and suggested gathering gradients into larger blocks instead.
- **Users consider parameter scaling methods**: A user targets scaling on a **single node**, exploring options like scattering to CPU and accumulating, or gathering on rank 0 on CPU for the optimizer step.
   - The goal is to find faster ways, highlighting the desire for an extensibility point in the system.

> `LM Studio SDK, Python, TypeScript, Agent API, MIT License` 


- **LM Studio SDKs Arrive for Python and TypeScript!**: LM Studio launched software developer kits for **Python** ([`lmstudio-python`](https://github.com/lmstudio-ai/lmstudio-python)) and **TypeScript** ([`lmstudio-js`](https://github.com/lmstudio-ai/lmstudio-js)), both under the **MIT license**.
   - These SDKs allow developers to tap into LM Studio's AI capabilities from their own code, including LLMs, embeddings models, and agentic flows.
- **LM Studio Introduces Agent-Oriented .act() API**: LM Studio introduced its first agent-oriented API, the **`.act()`** call, where the model autonomously executes tasks using provided tools over multiple rounds.
   - This API lets you give it a prompt and tools, and the model goes on its own autonomously for multiple execution *rounds* until it accomplishes the task (or gives up).
- **LM Studio SDK Documentation Now Live**: LM Studio released documentation for the **Python** ([`lmstudio-python`](https://lmstudio.ai/docs/python)) and **TypeScript** ([`lmstudio-js`](https://lmstudio.ai/docs/typescript)) SDKs, providing resources for interacting with **LLMs**, **embedding models**, and **agentic flows**.
   - The SDK allows you to use LLMs to respond in chats or predict text completions, define functions as tools, and turn LLMs into autonomous agents that run completely locally.

> `Context Length Error, Model Architecture unsupported by Llama.cpp, LM Studio CLI Commands, LM Studio SDKs, LM Studio Downgrading` 


- **LM Studio model failing to load and showing "Unsupported device" error**: Users are encountering a `Failed to load model` error with the message `Unsupported device` after updating LM Studio, potentially due to insufficient memory or incompatible model loading settings and were advised to try [adjusting **GPU offloading** or **thread pool size**](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1110598183144399061/1345995998471651348/image.png?ex=67c7e575&is=67c693f5&hm=a02e91bb46a53c67002d1787ae998888664e844574cba61a9e626bbe96a1ff6a&).
   - Context length can also impact memory usage; the left number is the number of **tokens** the model is using in the **chat history** already while the right number is the **context limit** (basically how long until the memory starts to truncate).
- **Diffusion Model architecture not supported by Llama.cpp**: Users are receiving `error loading model architecture: unknown model architecture: 'sd3'` when trying to load diffusion models, and it was clarified that [**llama.cpp does not support image/video/audio generation models**](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1110598183144399061/1345997397091811448/image.png?ex=67c7e6c2&is=67c69542&hm=93ffdc9a858570aeb67c46cc86eb5a391f447d55cbdb54b94b587bf29f609cd0&).
   - Support for vision models in `llama.cpp` is uncertain, with concerns about the lack of **Llama 3.2 vision** or **Pixtral vision support**, however, some believe that **UI-TARS fixes** will help a lot more.
- **Pseudollama bridges the OLLAMA gap**: A user asked if LM Studio endpoints were compatible with apps that take an OLLAMA endpoint, and it was answered that it is not supposed to work by default, but [**Pseudollama**](https://github.com/verbiate/Pseudollama) can bridge the gap.
   - The author noted that *this is 100% vibe coded, so there are likely dumb issues throughout, but it works.*
- **LM Studio SDK Documentation Released**: With the most recent release of LM Studio, [LM Studio CLI commands](https://lmstudio.ai/docs/cli) were documented, and a user confirmed that the **OpenAI API** continues to be supported and prioritized.
   - One member of the community noted that they were *waiting for this to come up so I can make a plugin*, noting that they wanted to *make a watch app communicator.*
- **Users find way to Downgrade LM Studio**: A user needed to downgrade to version **0.3.10** because the new version removed the ability for their preset to do a **tensor split** between their two cards.
   - Another user suggested using the [**web archive**](https://web.archive.org/web/20250221141151/https://lmstudio.ai/) to find the download link, while another said to just *switch up the download link parameters.*

- **Low-Rank Space Makes PEFT Reasonable**: A member suggested that since reasoning differences from base models are often in **low-rank space**, using **PEFT** for training becomes a reasonable approach, further suggesting the use of **Qwen 0.5B** for low-cost testing.
   - Others agreed that **low vram unsloth RL trainer** seems to work well because of this.
- **Nous API is coming?**: A member suggested that Nous provide their own API to use their models to generate income, especially given that current income is inconsistent, suggesting a possible pricing of **$0.8/M tokens** and estimating potential revenue of **$800-1600/day**.
   - Others suggested that Nous could charge closer to **$1/M input tokens, $3/M output tokens** for forge and others noted that there are ongoing efforts to make this happen.
- **LLMs struggle creating performant CUDA kernels**: Members discussed generating **CUDA kernels** with LLMs, with the consensus that while LLMs can output CUDA syntax, *no LLM is good at producing performant kernels on their own*.
   - The best strategy seems to involve augmenting the LLM with hardware and compute graph information, possibly using a **knowledge graph or GNN**, with a semi-manual approach involving extensive **GPU profiling**.
- **Hermes 3 Writes Erotic Fiction**: A user praised **Hermes 3's** unexpected talent for writing erotic fiction, expressing excitement for a future **NousChud** model iteration.
   - Another member mentioned they always have *something in the works* but they have a preference for models that can be run without needing a datacenter.
- **Ollama criticized for Beginner-Centric Design**: While **Ollama** is considered okay for beginners, it's criticized for being *terrible for people that are past the beginner stage* because it defaults to **Q4 quantization** even for 7B and 8B models.
   - Alternatives like **llama.cpp** or **koboldcpp** were suggested for more advanced users, but it was acknowledged that configuring and maintaining an environment is a different skill and can be too much to throw at someone at once.

   - The paper highlights key contributions such as *a system prompt that emphasizes the thinking and answering process, a stringent format reward function that penalizes outputs for taking shortcuts, and a straightforward training recipe that achieves stable convergence*.
- **RunwayML Introduces General World Models (GWM)**: [RunwayML](https://runwayml.com/research/introducing-general-world-models) is starting a new long-term research effort around what they call **general world models (GWM)**, aiming to build AI systems that understand the visual world and its dynamics to simulate future events.
   - They believe *the next major advancement in AI will come from systems that understand the visual world and its dynamics*.
- **Exploring LLMs' Emergent World Models**: Discussion revolves around the idea that **LLMs** construct **world models** as an emergent property from training on large datasets.
   - The conversation seeks to understand *the capabilities and limitations of these emergent world models*, especially how a **general world model** might enhance experiences or open new creative frontiers.
- **Worldsim's Profound Potential in Generative AI**: **Worldsim** hints at the potential of **generative AI** as a creative medium, with the ability to simulate entire worlds as interactive experiences.
   - One member is preparing work to continue **Worldsim**, likely in blog form, expressing uncertainty about making it a paper.

- **ReasonableLLAMA-Jr-3b Model Needs Your Feedback!**: A member is seeking feedback on their [ReasonableLLAMA-Jr-3b](https://ollama.com/adeelahmad/ReasonableLLAMA-Jr-3b) model, a reasoning model trained/finetuned using GRPO on **LLAMA 3.2 3B** quantized, using a custom written GRPO based Agent in Gym Env using MLX.
   - The model is based on the concepts described in the **Atom of Thoughts (AoT)** paper, where each state transition in the reasoning process is a self-contained, atomic question.
- **Recurrent LLM Reasoning: Too Expensive?**: Members discussed that recent recurrent LLM reasoning papers require significantly more compute (equivalent to a **32B** parameter model) to achieve performance comparable to a **7B** parameter model.
   - It begs the question: *why not just train a 32B parameter model* and use early exit, mixture of depths, or speculative decoding for cheaper inference?
- **Truncated Backpropagation: Still a Memory Hog?**: Although recurrent models use truncated backpropagation, the truncated depth (e.g., **8**) may still correspond to the activations of a significant-sized model (e.g., **15B**).
   - A member wondered if a **DEQ** type training would have worked, and questioned whether the *r and k* parameters were optimized.

- **Reports of AI Replacing Programmers are greatly exaggerated**: An [O'Reilly article](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-end-of-programming-as-we-know-it/) argues that **AI tools** will change programming, but it's not new, as programming has always evolved since the first programmers connected physical circuits.
   - A member commented that *“They've just find/replaced their old articles for AI”*, which is exactly like decrying people for copy-pasting from StackOverflow, and further stated that **LLMs** make learning new things much faster.
- **Senior Engineers Wield AI Better**: Senior engineers apply engineering wisdom to shape and constrain **AI's output**, preventing it from creating unmaintainable *“house of cards code”* when using tools like **Cursor** or **Copilot**.
   - The AI accelerates implementation, but their expertise is what keeps the code maintainable, a skill that junior engineers often miss.
- **Anthropic Achieves $61.5 Billion Valuation**: [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-raises-series-e-at-usd61-5b-post-money-valuation) has raised **$3.5 billion** at a **$61.5 billion** post-money valuation, led by **Lightspeed Venture Partners**, to advance AI systems, deepen understanding of how they work, and fuel international expansion.
- **Members hail Stagehand, seek Python Alternative**: After listening to the Latent Space podcast's episode featuring **Browserbase**, a member sought a self-healing browser workflow tool like **Stagehand** in Python.
   - A member pointed to [stagehand-py](https://pypi.org/project/stagehand-py/) and stated *“it's wip”*.
- **Claude Code vs Cursor, the cage match**: Members discussed [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview) and how it fares against **Cursor**, citing that **Cursor** is preferable due to its superior rollback process.
   - One member indicated that **Claude Code** has a harder time staying focused, tends to add extra lines of code, is more expensive, and that *“code edits in cursor are way way faster”*.

> `SIMD DType, Construction Checks, Globals vs Parameters` 


- **SIMD DType Dissected**: A user questioned the need to wrap a DType in `SIMD` for C bindings, as it obscures the original dtype, but another member clarified that `SIMD[DType.uint8, 1](0).type` returns the dtype at compile time.
   - They exemplified with `var a = UInt8(0); alias dtype = __typeof(a).type` to further clarify the use case.
- **SIMD Construction Under Scrutiny**: A member highlighted that `SIMD` includes [construction checks](https://github.com/modular/max/blob/main/mojo/stdlib/src/builtin/simd.mojo#L168) within its implementation.
   - This ensures the validity and type safety of `SIMD` objects upon creation.
- **Parameter Injection Praised**: When asked about using globals, one of the members stated that injecting parameters is always preferable to using globals.
   - The member claimed this is true, *if you have the time*.
