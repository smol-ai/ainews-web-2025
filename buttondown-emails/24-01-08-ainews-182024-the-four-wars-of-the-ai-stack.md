- **T5 Encoder-Decoder Clarification**: `@ricklius` inquired if T5 was an encoder-decoder to which `@stellaathena` confirmed it is, and mentioned that sometimes people detach the encoder from the encoder-decoder for usage.

- **DeepSeek AI Models' Learning Rate Schedules**: `@maxmatical` discussed DeepSeek AI models, particularly an unusual stepwise decay learning rate schedule they used that had the same final loss as the traditional cosine decay. While this method allows for more flexible use of checkpoints during pre-training, `@ad8e` highlighted the potential dangers of large learning rate steps, pointing out that misuse of learning rates could lead to suboptimal outcomes or even divergence in model training.

- **Potential Model Training Experiment**: `@ad8e` revealed an intention to test the idea behind the above-discussed learning rate steps. The intention was to see if a swift final stretch at 0.1xLR was all that's needed, possibly negating the need for a constant decay.

- **Discussion on Weight Decay and Gaussian Weight Noise**:  `@fessus` brought up the subject of the possible effects of combining gaussian weight noise and weight decay in a network that doesn't have learned affines in normalization layers. They reported potential benefits in terms of pruning unnecessary network complexity in toy datasets.

- **Transformers with Permuted Layers Idea**: `@kram1032` proposed a unique idea of permuting layers during training within a transformer architecture with constant layer size. Their hypothesis is that this approach may encourage the network to rely more on skip connections and could lead to more robust networks when it comes to adding or removing layers.

- **Looking for Reading Recommendations on LM Scaling Laws**: `@bshlgrs` sought recommendations for current state-of-the-art literature on **Language Model (LM) scaling laws**, specifically for Mixture of Experts (MoE) models. They specifically mentioned [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01169) which recommends MoE use only for LMs with less than 1 billion parameters, a claim appearing to be contested by practitioners.
- **Suggestion for LM Scaling Laws Paper**: `@philpax` highlighted a [recent paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00448) on LM scaling laws. Although this does not specifically address MoE models, it could offer relevant insights.
- **'Smaller and Longer' is the Key for Large Inference Demand**: `@bshlgrs` highlighted a key finding from the suggested paper, suggesting that for Language Model Manufacturers (LLM) with large inference demand (around 1 billion requests), the best strategy is to **train smaller models for a longer duration**.
- **Lack of High-Compute Budget Scaling Papers for MoE**: `@main.ai` pointed out the lack of papers addressing high compute budget scaling for MoE models.


### ‚ñ∑ #[lm-thunderdome](https://discord.com/channels/729741769192767510/755950983669874798/) (16 messagesüî•): 
        
- **Understanding lm-eval-harness Functions**: `@gson_arlo` asked how `lm-eval-harness` works with evaluation on datasets like MMLU (4-choice mcqa). `@baber_` confirmed that `output_type: generate_until` triggers a model's inference once, whereas `output_type: log_prob` calculates the likelihood four times, once for each probable completion.
- **Flexible Postprocessing for lm-eval-harness**: `@hyperion.ai` suggested enhancing `lm-eval-harness` with a loose and flexible post-processing factor, aligning closer to real-world practices where the answer output can be flexible yet correct. `@stellaathena` confirmed that the harness can handle such situations.
- **Implementing Custom Datasets in lm-eval-harness**: `@ishigami6465` inquired about the specific format of datasets needed for `lm-eval-harness`. `@hailey_schoelkopf` clarified that the user can define this in a task's configuration and explained how the configuration could work for different types of tasks.
- **Potential for Toxigen Grader in lm-eval-harness**: `@.johnnysands` brought up the idea of adding a toxicity/bias grader to lm-eval-harness, considering tools like LlamaGuard offer this functionality already. `@hailey_schoelkopf` affirmed that such grader models could be integrated, particularly if locally deployed to avoid disrupting the main evaluation model.
- **Considerations for Speculative Decoding**: `@stellaathena` highlighted the importance of speculative decoding, and `@hailey_schoelkopf` suggested that an inference library should handle this externally from lm-eval. Both believe the Hugging Face's TGI and tensorrt-llm currently manage this well.
