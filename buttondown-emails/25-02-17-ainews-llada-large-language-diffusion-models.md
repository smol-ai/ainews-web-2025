There was something today for everyone.

Ahead of the expected [Grok 3 release](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1890958798841389499) late tonight on a US holiday, today was a notable day of small things. Either:

- **the big model releases** of the day were the two StepFun models, [Step-Video-T2V](https://x.com/bdsqlsz/status/1891348664460714425?s=46) (30B Text to Video with remarkable coherence, including the famously hard ballerinas that Sora gets wrong) and [Step-Audio-Chat](https://huggingface.co/stepfun-ai/Step-Audio-Chat), a 132B voice to voice model
- or you could look at Scale AI's [EnigmaEval](https://x.com/alexandr_wang/status/1891208692751638939?s=46) (very hard multimodal puzzles) or Cambridge's [ZeroBench]( https://x.com/jrobertsai/status/1891506671056261413?s=46) (100 manually-curated multi-step visual reasoning questions) **evals where current frontier models score 0.**
- or you could look at [Schulman and Zoph's latest talk on post-training](https://x.com/johnschulman2/status/1891539960743743756).

But we choose to award today's title story to [LLaDA: Large Language Diffusion Models](https://ml-gsai.github.io/LLaDA-demo/), the first text diffusion model scaled up to be competitive with autoregressive models like Llama 3 8B.

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/007f0b39-2759-4568-93a6-b7c97ff6055a.png?w=960&fit=max)

This is a "white whale" alternative LLM architecture that has only been speculated about but never successfully scaled up til now. The main trick is adapting diffusion to predict uniformly masked tokens, producing text in a diffusion process:

![https://ml-gsai.github.io/LLaDA-demo/static/images/diff_normal_150ms.gif](https://ml-gsai.github.io/LLaDA-demo/static/images/diff_normal_150ms.gif)

For those used to text streaming in from left to right, diffusion doesn't seem very practical... until you try to infill between preset text structures and word choices that you desire, or create coherent long form story structures. LLaDA could be the start of something much bigger here.

**Theme 1. Nvidia GPUs: Compute Doubling in 10 Months Raises Questions**

- **[Nvidia compute is doubling every 10 months](https://i.redd.it/bs0887rrppje1.png)** ([Score: 481, Comments: 37](https://reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1irlie2/nvidia_compute_is_doubling_every_10_months/)): **NVIDIA's compute power** is projected to double every **10 months**, as illustrated by a graph showing exponential growth in FLOP/s from **2020 to 2024** across GPU generations: Hopper, Ampere, Volta, and Pascal. The data indicates a projected growth rate of **2.3x per year**, with a confidence interval between **2.2 and 2.5x**.
  - Users questioned the **accuracy of NVIDIA's compute power projections**, suggesting that the figures may involve comparing different precision levels (e.g., **FP16 to FP8**), which can exaggerate perceived performance gains. There was curiosity about the specific types of FLOPS being referenced, with assumptions leaning towards **Tensor FLOPS** likely in **FP16**.
  - Discussions compared the growth rate to **Moore's Law**, noting that while Moore's Law pertains to transistor counts, NVIDIA's projections encompass both performance and production scale. Users highlighted that the chart reflects total installed power, not just the power of individual GPUs, which can be misleading if production quantities increase.
  - There was skepticism about whether the growth rate would outstrip demand, with comments indicating that **demand for compute** is growing even faster than supply. Users inquired about the status of **Blackwell GPUs** and their potential to sustain this growth, reflecting on the need for more compute in areas like video processing.

> `Research on sampling techniques, Applications of transformers in time series, Use of repetition in creative writing contexts, NovelAI sampler understanding, Analysis of DEQs vs RNNs` 


- **NovelAI's Unique Sampler Knowledge**: NovelAI's understanding of sampling methods has evolved due to their decision to provide a wide variety of sampler algorithms, pushing developers to figure out the intricacies involved.
   - This contrasts with other organizations that initially did not offer complex samplers and thus lacked a reason to invest significant efforts into understanding them.
- **Challenges with Repetition in Text Generation**: The repetition penalty in text generation is a statistical method to mitigate common issues encountered with less skilled authors, who tend to overuse repetition in their writing.
   - While skilled authors can successfully utilize repetition for dramatic effect, distinguishing good repetition from bad remains a challenge in developing sampler policies.
- **Theory Behind Sampler Quality using Logprobs**: The approach described involves utilizing a cubic polynomial of the logprobs to approximate token quality, with some transformation applied to convert the quality back to logprobs.
   - The method adjusts logprobs such that middle values are increased while high and low values are penalized, although some distortion due to entropy considerations exists.
- **Comparing DEQs to RNNs**: Discussion around DEQs highlights their relationship with recurrent structures, focusing on the implications of weight tying and the potential for hidden layers to converge to fixed points.
   - Participants noted that, unlike RNNs which handle time variation, DEQs emphasize depth and can utilize implicit differentiation methods for backpropagation.
- **Exploration of Transformer's Suitability for Time Series**: There is ongoing debate about the effectiveness of transformers in time series contexts, with some criticizing their inability to handle specific structured problems like parity efficiently.
   - Research indicates that while transformers can be applied to time series data, traditional models like cubic splines often outperform them in capturing underlying patterns.

> `Nomic Embed Text V2, DeepSeek Model Bindings, GPT4All LocalDoc, Code Llama Template Issue, Model Tool Usage` 


- **Nomic Embed Text V2 Source Code Location**: A member expressed difficulty finding the **Nomic Embed Text V2** source code and training dataset on GitHub, the Nomic blog, and other resources.
   - Another member provided links to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nomic-ai/nomic) and the [Hugging Face page](https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v2-moe) to help locate the information.
- **Issues with DeepSeek Model Bindings**: A user reported errors when loading the **DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B-Q4_0.gguf** model, indicating potential issues with the **python bindings** being outdated.
   - Another member suggested that the problem might stem from using an older version of the **llama.cpp** library, noting that updates could resolve the conflict.
- **Configuring LocalDoc in GPT4All**: A user inquired about whether using **LocalDoc** in GPT4All sends data to the cloud and how to disable this after initially enabling it.
   - A response pointed out that users should ensure that the setting for **Enable Data Lake** is unselected to avoid cloud data sharing.
- **Setting Template for Code Llama**: A user needed assistance configuring a chat template for the **Code Llama** model they were using.
   - Another user provided a basic example for a message template, emphasizing that the model's specific repository or full name might be required for better support.
- **Determining Model Tool Usage**: A member asked how to verify whether a model can utilize tools effectively during execution.
   - The consensus provided was to check the model developer's documentation, noting that tools should be implemented only if the model was specifically trained on tool calling.
