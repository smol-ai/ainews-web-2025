> - `CUDA architecture details`
> - `Persistent threads`
> - `Occupancy and register usage` 


- **Understanding 4 Processing Blocks in CUDA**: A member highlighted that execution units in CUDA are allocated 'per quarter SM', necessitating balanced workloads across those 4 processing blocks for optimal performance.
   - *Persistent threads* can complicate scheduling, especially if thread blocks like 'producers' and 'consumers' aren't handled properly, which could lead to deadlocks.
- **Impact of Processors on Occupancy**: A member explained that an A100/H100 SM supports up to 64 warps, and that the division into 4 processors affects occupancy, as it reduces available warps in multiples of 4.
   - For instance, if a kernel requires 200 registers, it can effectively run 8 warps instead of the expected 10, thus complicating the use of *cudaLaunchCooperativeKernel*.
- **Strategizing Kernel Launch Parameters**: To ensure successful kernel launches, the *launch_bounds* feature can be specified to allocate the required warps, but may lead to wasted resources if not optimized correctly.
   - Using such bounds can help prevent deadlocks and ensure that register limits are properly managed by the CUDA compiler to align with available processing units.

> - `Buffer Count Workaround`
> - `Inefficiencies in Tensor Operations` 


- **Workaround for Tensor.sum() Issues**: A workaround was created using **qazalin's additional buffer count PR** to bypass errors caused by **Tensor.sum()**, which had trouble loading too many buffers at once.
   - *Iteratively adding and splitting up the operations* was necessary to navigate around the issue, despite being noted as **very inefficient** in its current version.
- **Norm Calculation Adjustments**: The script processes gradients by calculating **norms**, squaring them and summing them iteratively to manage memory better.
   - This approach involved creating groups of **norm1_squared** and **norm2_squared**, enhancing stability at the cost of efficiency.

> - `BF16 Training Challenges`
> - `Learning Rate Adjustments`
> - `Stochastic Rounding in Optimizers` 


- **BF16 Training Issues Demand Attention**: A member highlighted that the necessity to adjust the **learning rate** (LR) is linked to full **BF16** training since **BF16 weights** may not update correctly if changes are too minor.
   - This member suggested employing **BF16 mixed-precision training** to mitigate the issue, although it results in higher memory usage due to additional **FP32 gradients** and **optimization states**.
- **Understanding BF16 Effects in 1B Models**: A question was raised regarding why the **BF16** effect appears more significant in **1B models**, suggesting that fewer parameters might mean less gets updated.
   - Another member pointed out that the **BF16 weight update underflow** is influenced by the relation between `weight` and `weight_delta`, and proposed verification against **BF16 mixed-precision training** results.
- **Experimenting with Stochastic Rounding**: A member expressed interest in adding **stochastic rounding** to the optimizer for weight updates to assess its utility for **Torchtune**.
   - They indicated a willingness to conduct experiments, weighing the experimental benefits against potential complications.

> - `Geoffrey Hinton Nobel Comparison`
> - `Model Merging at Scale` 


- **Geoffrey Hinton's future Nobel Award perception**: In 50 years, giving a Nobel award to **Geoffrey Hinton** will be viewed similarly to today's perspective on the award for lobotomy awarded to **Moniz** in 1949 for its *therapeutic value in psychoses*.
   - *Hinton misunderstands modern machine learning* profoundly, indicating a disconnect with current advancements.
- **Insights on Large-Scale Model Merging**: **New research** from a Google intern discusses large-scale model merging scenarios involving models up to **64 billion parameters**.
   - The study explores how **model size**, merging methods, and expert numbers affect **held-in performance and generalization**, with findings detailed in their [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03617).
