  **18 guilds**, **277 channels**, and **1342 messages** were analyzed with an
  estimated reading time saved of **187 minutes**. The community switched to
  **GPT-4 turbo** from GPT-4-32k. Emerging **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** models
  like **Mixtral**, **DeepSeekMOE**, and **Phixtral** are gaining traction,
  alongside innovative **model merging** techniques such as linear interpolation
  and "frankenmerges" by **SOLAR** and **Goliath**. Discussions include **AI
  playgrounds** supporting prompt and LLM parameter tuning, with recommendations
  for **LangFlow** and **langchain** integrated with **GPT-4** for data
  analysis. Security concerns about third-party cloud usage and Discord bot
  compliance with TOS were raised. Notable performance differences between
  **GPT-4 0613** and **GPT-4 turbo** were highlighted, favoring GPT-4 turbo for
  conversational and creative tasks. The community also debated fine-tuning
  strategies involving **DPO**, **LoRA**, and safetensors, and explored
  integrating **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** with API calls using
  function-calling models. Discussions on MoE versus dense LLM communication
  styles and the use of **llama index** and **SciPhi-AI synthesizer** for RAG
  data frameworks were prominent. Issues with anomalous characters during

<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->> We checked **18** guilds, **277** channels, and **1342** messages for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **187 minutes**. New: we also switched to GPT-4 turbo today. Let us know how it feels vs previous days (GPT-4-32k)!

A bunch of MoE models have sprung up since the Mixtral architecture has been published - [DeepSeekMOE](https://x.com/deepseek_ai/status/1745304852211839163?s=46&t=90xQ8sGy63D2OtiaoGJuww), [Phixtral](https://twitter.com/maximelabonne/status/1744867841436700850). But equally interesting is the practice of "model merging" - from naive (spherical) linear interpolation to "frankenmerges" used by SOLAR and Goliath. It seems that these techniques have created a new growth spurt in the open leaderboards as even [relatively naive implementations](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38882726) are handily beating vanilla incumbents from the big labs.

Only 1 channel had activity, so no need to summarize...

- **GCP Waives Egress Fees Due to New EU Regulation**: `@stevekamman` highlighted that **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** is eliminating egress fees for data transfer to other clouds as a response to a new **EU regulation**. He expects **Azure** and **AWS** to follow suit. This change is intended to make it cheaper to switch cloud providers, although it does not simplify the complex economics of data transfer pricing. An attached diagram illustrates this complexity, but the diagram was not included in the message.

- **Examining Groq's Approach to AI Hardware**: `@stevekamman` shared links discussing **Groq**'s hardware capabilities, specifically the **LLAMA7B** model running on Groq's architecture. A general [architecture paper](https://groq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ISCA-TSP.pdf) outlines their "Superlane" concept and clocking variance. For those seeking a simpler explanation, he shared a [plain-english explainer](https://groq.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GROQ-ROCKS-NEURAL-NETWORKS.pdf) on how Groq's technology innovates neural network processing, but also noted a lack of signs of adoption in practical settings.
