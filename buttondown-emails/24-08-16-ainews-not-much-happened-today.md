- **Sarvam AI: Voice-to-Voice Agent**: Sarvam AI, an Indian company, has developed a voice-to-voice agent that can speak in both English and Indian languages.
   - The company offers an interactive experience that allows users to engage with the agent by speaking in any Indian language, which can then be used to explain products, share presentations, and schedule meetings.
- **LLMs Develop Understanding of Reality**: A new study from MIT explores how large language models (LLMs) are developing their own understanding of reality.
   - Researchers found that LLMs can generate descriptions of sensory experiences, like the scent of rain, despite lacking real-world experience, suggesting that these models may be drawing upon their training data to generate these responses.
- **LongWriter: Unleashing 10,000+ Word Generation**: LongWriter is a tool that enables LLMs to generate over 10,000 words from long context.
   - This tool leverages the capabilities of long context LLMs to produce lengthy and detailed text outputs.
- **Long Context RAG Performance**: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a widely adopted AI technique that improves LLM accuracy by retrieving information from external sources.
   - With the advent of LLMs with longer context lengths, such as Anthropic Claude, GPT-4-turbo, and Google Gemini 1.5 pro, the question arises whether these models will eventually replace RAG workflows, as they can now handle larger volumes of data within their context windows.

- **Hermes 3 405B Model: Performance and Use Cases**: Hermes 3 405B is a powerful new open-source AI model that excels at a mix of tasks, including style transfer, summarization, and creative writing, often with tons of parallel instructions.
   - It outperforms the Meta's bf16 instruct model in these use cases, with response speeds only slightly slower than GPT-3.5 sonnet, making it a strong contender for research and development.
- **Long Context: Benchmarking and Observations**: While there are no formal long-context benchmarks specifically comparing Hermes 3 405B with Llama 3.1, anecdotal evidence suggests it handles multi-turn chats flawlessly up to 16k context.
   - However, users have reported some odd generation outputs when testing with 50k context, suggesting potential degradation in long context capabilities compared to the base model.
- **Amnesiac Mode: An Unexpected Feature**: Hermes 3 405B exhibits an interesting 'Amnesiac Mode' at temperatures of 0.2 or lower, where the model frequently provides the same outputs for different inputs.
   - The cause is yet unknown, but some theorize it might be similar to mode collapse, where many input tokens trigger similar output tokens, and potential explanations could be related to the training dataset or specific model architecture choices.
- **Running Large Models Locally: Challenges and Solutions**: Running models as large as Hermes 3 405B locally requires specialized hardware and substantial optimization efforts due to memory constraints.
   - Multiple high-end GPUs, like 4x 4090s for FP16 or 8x 4090s for FP8, are required, with 4-bit potentially requiring 4 cards but still being tight. Users may need to utilize techniques like CPU offloading and model parallelism to squeeze the model onto more modestly equipped machines.
- **Federated Learning: Potential for Hermes-Nous Integration**: Federated Learning, a method for training models on decentralized data sources, presents an opportunity to leverage Hermes-Nous as a central model, potentially improving performance and adaptability.
   - This would involve leveraging the strengths of Hermes-Nous as a large, capable language model, while simultaneously incorporating data from various decentralized sources to enhance its knowledge and capabilities.

> - `New Special Tokens`
> - `Thinking Tokens` 


- **Hermes 3 Is Out Now!**: A member shared that they just read the Hermes 3 report and noted that it features new special tokens for "thinking", including `<SCRATCHPAD>`, `<REASONING>`, `<INNER_MONOLOGUE>`, `<PLAN>`, `<EXECUTION>`, `<REFLECTION>`, `<THINKING>`, `<SOLUTION>`, `<EXPLANATION>`, and `<UNIT_TEST>`.
   - The report also details new tokens for RAG, tool calling, and structured JSON output.
- **Thinking Tokens Need Quantization?**: A member expressed curiosity about the new "thinking" tokens and wondered if they make sense without quantized tokens.
   - The member did not provide any additional information.
- **Prior Preservation Loss Implementation Issues**: A member shared that the implementation of prior preservation loss in `diffusers` appears incorrect and they couldn't find a correct implementation of Dreambooth's prior preservation loss.
   - They suspect that the `diffusers` implementation may be simply treating regularization images as training images, doubling the batch size, and nothing more.
- **Gradio Client Latency Issues**: A member raised a concern about high latency in `gradio_client`, noting that actual bot prediction takes only 0.02 seconds but calling the route from `gradio_client` takes 2 seconds.
   - The member did not provide any additional information.
- **LLMs Develop Understanding of Reality**: A member shared a [MIT News article](https://news.mit.edu/2024/llms-develop-own-understanding-of-reality-as-language-abilities-improve-0814) about research into how LLMs develop their own understanding of reality as their language abilities improve.
   - The article discusses how LLMs can describe complex concepts like smell without having prior experience or the ability to sense it, suggesting that LLMs may be mimicking text from training data rather than developing a true understanding.

> - `P40 Power Consumption`
> - `Tensor Split`
> - `GPU Idle Power Draw`
> - `llama.cpp Power Management` 


- **P40 Power Consumption Myth Busted**: There's a common misconception that multiple P40s (even 10) will consume a combined power of 1kW for inference, but this is false.
   - When used for LLMs, they'll draw power sequentially, meaning the total consumption will be close to that of a single GPU (around 250W).
- **Tensor Split & GPU Bottlenecks**: Disabling offload to the GTX with tensor split (set to 0,1 or the opposite in the configuration file) is crucial, as a 2GB GTX will bottleneck a T4 with 4GB combined memory.
   - Search for 'tensor split' to learn more about this configuration option.
- **Idle Power Draw is a Hardware Issue**: Even when the model is loaded in idle, each P40 will consume at least 60W (sometimes 80-100W) due to the power required to keep the VRAM loaded.
   - This behavior is similar to how 3D scenes with large textures (4-8K) consume power to keep the textures stored in memory.
- **llama.cpp Power Management Tools**: There are tools like [gppm](https://github.com/crashr/gppm) that can help manage GPU power and performance, particularly with CLI apps on top of llama.cpp.
   - This could potentially reduce idle power consumption from 50W per P40 to just 9W, which would be a significant improvement.

> - `Merriam-Webster Dictionary`
> - `The word 'of'` 


- **Could of, a Grammar Fallacy?**: A member noticed the phrase "could of" in a post and questioned if it was a grammar fallacy.
   - The member referenced [a substack article](https://open.substack.com/pub/nealstephenson/p/deeply?r=68gy5&utm_medium=ios) related to this topic.
- **Deeply, the new very?**: The author noticed a rise in the usage of the word 'deeply' in public discourse and believes it has become the universal adverb.
   - The author referenced [Merriam-Webster's definition of the word 'cant'](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cant) and suggested 'deeply' is replacing 'very' in similar fashion.
- **Merriam-Webster, is 'Could of' a Real Word?**: The author posed a pop-quiz asking the reader what part of speech is the word 'of.'
   - The author included a [picture](https://merriam-webster.com/assets/mw/images/article/art-wap-article-main/alt-59aef06dec76b-4182-4bcf8df2c2b60e6887d6b9b5103b98ea@2x.jpg) depicting a typical response to the phrase "'Could of' is backed by the dictionary."
- **'Of' is a Verb?**: The author answered the pop-quiz by stating that 'of' is usually a preposition, but can also function as a verb when used as a substitution for 'have,' as in the phrase 'I could of written it correct.'
   - The author anticipated that the reader would be angered by this use and the fact that Merriam-Webster included this sense of 'of' in their dictionary.

> - `String indexing`

> - `Grapheme clusters`
> - `Memory efficiency` 


- **String Indexing by Code Points**: A member questioned the decision to index strings by code points, citing a [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/5o13kk/lets_stop_ascribing_meaning_to_code_points/) where it was argued that code points are not a meaningful primitive for most string processing tasks.
   - Another member agreed, stating that while code points are simpler and faster to compute, the ultimate goal should be grapheme clusters, and this should be a parameter on the String.
- **User-Controllable Indexing**: A member suggested an `index_type` parameter for the String, allowing for cases like `byte`, `codepoint`, and `grapheme`, giving users maximum control over indexing.
   - They explained that if you know your data is all ASCII, you can use byte indexing for improved space and computational efficiency.
- **Memory Efficiency Optimization**: A member raised concerns about the efficiency of `memcpy`, which is used in combination with zeroing and index building, resulting in three passes over the memory.
   - They suggested that fusing the copy and indexing operations could potentially improve performance by reducing the number of passes over the memory.
