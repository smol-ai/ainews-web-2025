- **MoE Limited to FFN Layers in Most Architectures**: Discussants confirmed that in most architectures, the experts in a Mixture of Experts (MoE) are **only the feedforward networks (FFN)** layers. Attention blocks as experts have been explored, though not standard.

- **Interest in Integrating Autoregressive and Diffusion Models with MoE**: The concept of combining autoregressive models (strong in text generation) with diffusion models (excellent for image tasks), using an MoE structure to potentially enhance multimodal model performance, was discussed. Skepticism exists, but the theoretical integration could offer advancements in model capabilities.

- **Prompt Templates and Their Impact on LLM Performance**: Dialogue clarified that using the specific prompt format a large language model was trained on can drastically affect its reliability. For example, the chatml format is used by **Hermes**, whereas **Alpaca Prompt Format** might be preferred by others.

- **Handling Unsafe Behavior Input in Models**: It was mentioned that built-in safety measures and "life lesson" responses in models can be manipulated with system level prompts to modify responses. Techniques to circumvent refusals and induce more direct responses were suggested, along with referenced online resources like [Handling Refusals](https://huggingface.co/failspy/llama-3-70B-Instruct-abliterated/blob/main/ortho_cookbook.pdf).

- **Finetuning Challenges with Llama3 and Axolotl Systems**: A user shared issues and solutions while attempting to fine-tune the Llama3 model with the dolphin-2.9 dataset using the Axolotl system. Problems like CUDA errors and the necessity of updating packages like flash-attn were discussed, pointing to community-driven solutions for technical bottlenecks.

- **Revealing ChatQA: An Innovator in Conversational QA**: A recent [Arxiv submission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10225) introduces **ChatQA**, a QA model line that surpasses **GPT-4** in conversational accuracy by using a two-stage instruction tuning and a cost-effective dense retriever. ChatQA-70B outperforms GPT-4 with a score of 54.14 versus 53.90 across various datasets, offering a cheaper alternative without the need for synthetic data from GPT models.

- **IBM/RedHat's Novel Training Approach**: IBM and RedHat are collaborating on a [new project](https://github.com/instructlab) that innovates LLM training by using a larger model to generate synthetic datasets without full retraining. The process, detailed on GitHub, employs taxonomies for curriculum building and leverages powerful LLMs like **Granite** and **Merlinite**.

- **Framework for Enhanced Model Training Introduced**: A deeper dive into IBM/RedHat's project reveals a scheduled information enrichment process for LLMs. Contributors can format and submit data weekly, which after curation, is integrated into models like Granite and Merlinite to incrementally enhance their knowledge base.
