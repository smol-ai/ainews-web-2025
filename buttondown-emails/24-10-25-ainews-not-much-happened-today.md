> - `Llama 3.2 Open Sourcing`
> - `Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)`
> - `QLoRA vs QAT`
> - `HQQ+ Concept`
> - `Mixing Precision Techniques`

- **Llama 3.2 Models for Edge Deployments**: Meta open sourced **Llama 3.2** 1B and 3B models, focusing on **on-device** and **edge deployments** to meet community demand. Developers are actively quantizing these models to optimize memory usage, albeit often at a **performance tradeoff**.
  
  - These quantized models aim to provide faster inference and portability while maintaining quality even in resource-constrained environments.
- **Dissecting Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)**: QAT involves applying a **fake quantization** process that simulates quantizing model weights while retaining high precision. The goal is to help the model adapt through training without actually casting weights to lower precision during the fine-tuning process.
  
  - Using this method, model accuracy can potentially recover after quantization, making it an attractive technique for developers.
- **QLoRA and QAT: A Semantic Distinction**: Despite similarities, QAT and QLoRA differ in their approaches to weight handling, where QAT maintains higher precision during training. One participant noted that merging back into original weights often yields better results, contrasting the typical QLoRA process.
  
  - Options for combining weights post-quantization are being explored, with discussions around operational outcomes highlighting the intricacies involved.
- **HQQ+: Enhanced Model Recovery Techniques**: The HQQ+ approach suggests using **LoRA weights** to recover accuracy while keeping them in **FP16** for improved performance. Merging these weights with the original model is preferred, leveraging the fact that quantization errors can rank higher with lower bit widths.
  
  - Implementing group sizes in weight adjustments could enhance efficiency in model operations, an idea worth exploring further.
- **Precision Tactics and Operational Challenges**: Discussions reveal that different approaches to using **dequantization** indicate varying outcomes, with some members advocating for FP16 weights to be retained for better results. There are concerns that unsupervised settings and tweaks may still yield outputs with errors, necessitating further exploration.
  
  - Participants are considering using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) techniques to address outliers in LoRA weights, showcasing an innovative angle on existing methodologies.

> - `DPO Evaluations`
> - `Axolotl Codebase`
> - `Evaluation Metrics`
> - `Model Predictions`
> - `Training Callbacks`

- **Yes, DPO Evaluations are Possible**: You can perform evaluations for **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)** using the Axolotl codebase, which involves loading datasets and comparing predictions to ground truth.
  
  - The evaluation process starts with using the `load_prepare_dpo_datasets` function to load your evaluation dataset.
- **Preparing the Model for Evaluation**: It's important to ensure that your DPO model is in evaluation mode by executing `model.eval()` before generating predictions.
  
  - This disables features like dropout that could affect the evaluation's integrity.
- **Generating Predictions from the Dataset**: Predictions can be generated by iterating over the evaluation dataset and collecting outputs with torch's no_grad context to save memory.
  
  - This approach ensures that predictions are efficient and do not track gradients.
- **Computing Evaluation Metrics**: Various metrics, such as accuracy or F1 score, can be computed after generating predictions using libraries like scikit-learn.
  
  - For instance, you can calculate accuracy using `accuracy_score` by comparing predicted labels against true labels.
- **Incorporating Callbacks into Training**: You can integrate evaluation into the training process using callbacks like `BenchEvalCallback` to perform evaluations at set intervals.
  
  - These callbacks allow for seamless integration of evaluation metrics into your training routine.

> - `MIPROv2`
> - `Prompt Generation`
> - `GSM8K Dataset`

- **MIPROv2 Techniques for Automated Prompt Generation**: A member shared a [quick thread](https://x.com/karthikkalyan90/status/1849902254373077196) on implementing 'automatic prompt generation' using techniques from **MIPROv2 optimizer**.
  
  - The implementation utilizes the **GSM8K dataset** with three modules: one for demo generation, another for instructions, and a final module to compile these outputs into a complete prompt.
- **Three Modular Approach to Prompt Creation**: The program consists of three modules to streamline the generation process: **Module 1** generates demos, **Module 2** creates instructions, and **Module 3** compiles the outputs into the final prompt.
  
  - This approach aims to enhance the effectiveness of prompt generation through systematic structuring.
