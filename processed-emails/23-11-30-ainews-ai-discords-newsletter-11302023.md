    - `@leoalvarenga` sought advice for providing instructions to GPTs. `@.pythagoras` and `@adx2061` suggested a format mimicking programming languages using colons and brackets for better accuracy.
    - `@8020` reported that their Custom GPT, which extracts text from a file and summarizes it, faced issues with the GPT-4 API, suggesting the issue lies within custom GPTs, not the API itself.


### ▷ Channel: [prompt-engineering](https://discord.com/channels/974519864045756446/1046317269069864970) (83 messages): 

- **Prompt Engineering Techniques**: `@madame_architect` shared recently published prompting techniques such as Chain of Note, Contrastive Chain of Thoughts, System 2 Attention, Thread of Thoughts, Take a Deep Breath, Emotional Prompts, Simulation Theory of Mind, and Step Back Prompting. Each technique was supplemented with a corresponding ArXiv reference number for further reading.
- **Experience with GPT-3**: `@exh0rt` discussed their experience of working on a prompt designed like a game with specific rules and outlined challenges in maneuvering GPT's interpretations of the rules, having it maintain a desired tone, and dealing with instructional conflicts.
- **Generating Outcomes**: `@eskcanta` suggested that `@exh0rt` provide clear instructions that detail what the AI is supposed to do rather than stating what it should not do, to avoid confusion and foster better outcome generation.
- **Identifying Conflicts**: `@eskcanta` highlighted the importance of identifying instructional conflicts within the prompts given to the AI. They suggested asking the AI to evaluate instructions for ambiguity, potential conflict, and confusion, and to list points of conflict.
- **Discussion on Tone and Language**: `@exh0rt` and `@eskcanta` had an extensive discussion on setting a tone for the AI, dealing with instructional conflicts concerning language use (jargon vs technical terms), and communicating expectations to the AI effectively. They further detailed processes for conflict resolution, understanding the AI's interpretation of instructions, and setting up efficient communication rules.


### ▷ Channel: [api-discussions](https://discord.com/channels/974519864045756446/1046317269069864970) (83 messages): 

- **API-disucssions on OpenAI Discord Server**: Members `@exh0rt` and `@eskcanta` discuss issues with the former's instructions to a language model. Key suggestions from `@eskcanta` included:
    - Directly telling the AI what to do instead of using negative language (i.e., what not to do).
    - Identifying conflicting instructions and rectifying them to avoid confusion.
    - Clearly defining contexts and expectations.
    - Avoiding repetition as the AI has a good memory and can comprehend from the first instance.
    - Making sure the instructions don't have unnecessary aggression as the AI is programmed to be compliant and not argue.
- `@exh0rt` contemplated incorporating GPT's suggestions for clarification and resolving conflicts within his script-generating game prompt setup. He planned to run the modified game and see if the newer set of rules were easier for the AI to handle.
- Later, `@madame_architect` shared new techniques for prompt engineering identified in various research papers published in the last 30 days. Some ideas included "Chain of Note", "Contrastive Chain of Thoughts", "System 2 Attention", "Thread of Thoughts", "Take a Deep Breath", "Emotional Prompts", "Simulation Theory of Mind", and "Step Back Prompting".
- `@leoalvarenga` was seeking a template for creating custom GPT setups, but no responses were given to his query within the captured discussion.
- `@exh0rt` summarized his understanding and main takeaways from the detailed discussions into a succinct list of rules for future reference, which `@eskcanta` further clarified.

### ▷ Channel: [general](https://discord.com/channels/1038097195422978059/1038097196224086148) (18 messages): 

- **Interleaved Streaming in React Framework**: `@liminalstvte` asked about implementing interleaved streaming in the React framework, specifically he wants to detect when a function in Langchain LLM is called and then provide an answer and continue the conversation.
- **Location of Documented Files in LangChain**: Users `@daii3696` and `@baytaew` sought guidance on how to find the exact file locations that are frequently referenced in LangChain documentation, such as 'Defined in docs/api_refs/langchain/src/chains/conversational_retrieval_chain.ts:33'.
- **Streaming Responses to FastAPI Endpoints**: `@sid.pocketmail` requested assistance in streaming responses to a FastAPI endpoint for OPENAI_FUNCTIONS_AGENT, asking for specifics on the AsyncCallbackHandler function.
- **Preventing Hallucination in RAG Retriever**: `@legendary_pony_33278` inquired about setting a similarity threshold for the RAG Retriever (Faiss or Chroma) such that if no document in the vector database exceeds the threshold, no source is returned. This, they believe, would help prevent hallucination.
- **Bounty for LangChain Integration into E2B**: A financial reward was offered by `@unicorn1997` for integrating LangChain into E2B, an open-source sandbox for AI agents. They provided a [link](https://github.com/e2b-dev/E2B/issues/242) to the bounty details on GitHub.

- Discussion regarding a new concept coined as **"knowledge-guided attention"** for AI models introduced by `@maxwellandrews`, aiming at efficient handling of long documents by creating a temporary entity graph. This approach is designed to resemble human recall processes by focusing on entity relationships rather than verbatim text. A GitHub repository for relevant research on a [knowledge graph attention network](https://github.com/xiangwang1223/knowledge_graph_attention_network) was shared.
- Conversations about AI/ML career paths, with `@jaisel` asking about how others knew they wanted to focus on ML/AI. `@teknium` shared his personal experience that was sparked with the advent of stable diffusion and the release of chatgpt. Also, during this discussion, two YouTube videos were posted, however, no discussion around these videos took place.
- Detailed metric scores of the [Qwen/Qwen-72B model](https://github.com/Nous-Research/hf-causal-experimental) were shared in the benchmarks log. An issue was raised concerning a potential problem with the `bigbench` task by main.ai, while `@gabriel_syme` engaged the group to explain the meaning behind the benchmarking data.
- Sharing of posts highlighting new techniques, including one that enables a **70b LLM inference on a single 4GB GPU**, and another introducing **Adept Experiments** as a possible technique for fine-tuning agents.

- Discussions on various language models, including **1.8B Qwen**, **72B Qwen**,  and **70B LLaMA-2**. Models were compared considering the performance and mentioned a need for independent evaluations. Community interest was expressed in **Open Source Contributions**, and multilingual data was discussed. The potential for future models like **Hermes 2.6**, **Qwen 3b**, **Qwen 14b**, **Yi 34B**, a 70B model, **Mistral 70b** or **Yi 100b** were also a point of discussion.
- A pizza emoji (🍕) was shared in the welcoming channel by user `@rgbkrk` without any provided context.
- Discussion on the best stack for pretraining, conversations around hardware requirements for GGUF models, and instability of Quant models with function calling. User `@b_mc2` posted a link and asked for details about vision Hermes. Discussion on SERP API pricing and alternatives took place.
- Queries about the **Collective Cognition Models on Huggingface Leaderboard** and clarification on project ownership concerning **Open Access AI Collective**.
- A comic relief message mentioning **LIGHT MODE**, a common display option in applications, was shared suggesting an ongoing discussion or inside joke within the community about preferred display modes.

### ▷ Channel: [ctx-length-research](https://discord.com/channels/1053877538025386074/1108104624482812015) (1 messages): 

- **Knowledge-guided Attention**: `@maxwellandrews` proposed a concept of focusing the attention of AI models more efficiently when dealing with long documents. His concept, termed "knowledge-guided attention," involves creating a temporal entity graph in a "scratchpad" while sliding over the context with a fixed-sized window (e.g., 2048 tokens). The model would then attend between the user's query and the knowledge graph and potentially the original passages that were used to create the relevant nodes in the knowledge graph. He emphasized that this approach is more reflective of how the human mind works - instead of recalling verbatim text, we remember a compressed representation of entity relationships (essentially an entity embedding). He shared a potentially relevant GitHub repository of a [knowledge graph attention network](https://github.com/xiangwang1223/knowledge_graph_attention_network).
