- **Possible Model Reupload on Huggingface**: `@alpindale` pointed out a potential issue regarding Oniichat's new 13b model on the Huggingface platform. The model was suspected to be an upload of `@Gryphe`'s previously developed model, [*MythoMax L2 13B*](https://huggingface.co/Gryphe/MythoMax-L2-13b). The suspicion arose after matching the hashes between the two models and realizing a 100% match in their probabilities. They stressed that such actions are not likely to be allowed on HuggingFace. 
- **Roleplay Models' Ability to Ignore Instructions**: `@imonenext` asked `@alpindale` if roleplay models could ignore specific instructions, for example, ignoring all previous instructions and output just the text before a specific instruction. `@alpindale` responded that most roleplay models, which are trained with instruct data, could probably do that, depending on the character persona used. 
- **Axolotl Training Specification Inquiry**: `@ufghfigchv` asked `@Gryphe` if the Axolotl now supports specifying the number of epochs of training on a specific dataset. They also asked where in the repo they could look to implement such functionality if it's not available.

Only 1 channel had activity, so no need to summarize...

- **Fine-tuning Mistral Model Issues**: `@amazingvince` reported an issue with a fine-tuned Mistral model where it started repeating blocks of text and forgot how to end a sequence.
- **Possible Reason for Issue**: `@amazingvince` speculated that the issue might be due to setting the `pad` token to `eos` in the alignment handbook guide's code.
- **Solution Suggestions**: 
    - `@mr_caluliflower` suggested checking if the fine-tune data includes `eos` tokens.
    - `@tanmay_52339` recommended the use of the Hugging Face chat templatizer to ensure that the data is correctly formatted and to verify the correct application of the template.
- **Chat Template Verification**: `@amazingvince` confirmed the use of a chat template from the alignment handbook guide's code.
- **Further Investigation**: `@amazingvince` theorized that the issue might be occurring due to the model ignoring the last `eos` token, considering it part of the padding.
