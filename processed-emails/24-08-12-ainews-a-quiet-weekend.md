> - `Online PPO Implementation`
> - `Hyperparameter Recommendations` 


- **Seeking Optimal Online PPO for RLHF**: A member inquired about the best implementation of traditional **RLHF** using **online PPO**, specifically looking for hyperparameter recommendations and reproducible results.
   - The aim is to demonstrate that **online PPO** outperforms **iterative DPO**, as claimed in related research such as [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10719).
- **Current Implementations Lacking Optimality**: A response indicated that there is currently no definitive best implementation for the discussed traditional **RLHF** with **online PPO**.
   - They suggested using the [EasyLM repository](https://github.com/hamishivi/EasyLM) or the refactored **TRL** version from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/main/en/ppov2_trainer) as viable options.
