- **Gemma 3 Sizes and Hugging Face Integration**: Unsloth now supports **Gemma 3**, Google's new state-of-the-art multimodal (text + image) models that come in **1B**, **4B**, **12B**, and **27B** sizes, and have a **128K** context window, and multilingual support as detailed in their [blog post](https://unsloth.ai/blog/gemma3).
   - All versions of **Gemma 3**, including 2-8 bit GGUFs, dynamic 4-bit, and 16-bit versions, have been uploaded to [Hugging Face here](https://huggingface.co/collections/unsloth/gemma-3-67d12b7e8816ec6efa7e4e5b).
- **AGPL3 Licensing: UI and Unsloth's Future**: The main Unsloth package will remain under the **Apache 2.0** license, but a better/more advanced version of Unsloth with a UI will be licensed under **AGPL3**.
   - The AGPL3 license affects those using/selling Unsloth as a training service; if you distribute Unsloth AGPL3 code over a network or sell it as a service, you must open source your code changes as AGPL3 as well.
- **GGUF Formats Don't Support QLoRA**: A member asked if **QLoRA** supports **GGUF quantization formats**, and the answer was no, you're better off using **safetensors**.
   - Another member stated that Hugging Face currently does not support GGUF so Unsloth can't do anything about it yet.
- **Mistral Small 3 GGUFs models out**: Unsloth released the new Mistral Small 3.1 GGUFs and 4bit models that is also supported in Unsloth and linked the collection here: [Mistral Small 3 all version](https://huggingface.co/collections/unsloth/mistral-small-3-all-versions-679fe9a4722f40d61cfe627c).

> `bnbso alternatives, QLoRA NF4 dequantization, Unsloth open positions` 


- **Breaking BNB Dependency**: The team discussed the need to explore alternatives to **bnbso** to enhance context and overcome limitations in dequantization, since the dependency on wrappers like the **bnb library** is limiting Unsloth's potential.
   - They suggested researching and implementing a solution from scratch, but acknowledge the challenge due to CUDA's closed-source nature.
- **Triton Kernel Triumph for QLoRA NF4 Dequantization**: A member highlighted a post on implementing a **Triton kernel** for dequantizing **QLoRA NF4** quantized weights, achieving performance improvements of **1.6X to 1.8X** for **LLaMA** models ([GitHub](https://github.com/lweitkamp/qlora_dequantize_triton)).
   - The speed gains from the implementation increase as model size scales up, with the author noting that Unsloth released a list of challenging tasks, one of them being this very dequantization.
- **Unsloth AI is hiring!**: Unsloth AI has open positions offering **$500K/year + equity** for Founding Engineers and **$250K - $300K/year** for ML Engineers ([X post](https://x.com/danielhanchen/status/1891194528931209644)).
   - The positions can be obtained by scoring 47 or 32 points respectively in challenges such as converting **nf4 / BnB 4bit to Triton** and making **FSDP2** work with **QLoRA** ([submission guide](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JqKqA1XWeLHvnYAc0wzrR4JBCnq43HyH?usp=sharing)).

> `Gemma 3, Ollama and Gemma, Phi-4-mini-instruct, Multi-GPU Support, AMD Support` 


- ****Gemma 3**'s Hallucinations and Quantization Troubles**: Users report **Gemma 3** models experiencing hallucination issues, particularly the 12B variant, while attempting to run low quantization versions.
   - Some suggest that the official **Ollama** models might be necessary and advise checking the Ollama Discord for support, though some community members report image support on some models, but not **Gemma**.
- ****Phi-4-mini-instruct**'s Bug Fixes**: Users are encountering errors with **phi4-mini-instruct** when using GRPO (Gradient Ratio Preference Optimization) and suggest checking the [collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/unsloth/phi-4-all-versions-677eecf93784e61afe762afa) of **Phi-4** versions with bug fixes and dynamic quants.
   - One community member mentioned, *"The fact that it doesn't repro makes me wonder if I setup my config for the training run correctly - i'm guessing not"* indicating the difficulty to replicate the errors.
- **Multi-GPU Support arrives with Unsloth's Non-Invasive Approach**: A contributor has implemented multi-GPU support for **Unsloth** using a non-invasive approach with accelerate, tested on local setups and Kaggle, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/MrShahzebKhoso/unsloth/tree/multi-gpu-support).
   - Users discuss merging models saved across multiple GPUs, referencing the accelerate documentation for saving one merged model.
- **AMD support in Unsloth incoming!**: Community members inquire about AMD support, and developers indicate potential support within the next three months, noting that BnB and Triton are now supported on AMD.
   - It was mentioned by a community member, *"Apparently BnB and triton is now supported in AMD and someone said if you just change some parts of unsloth, it'll work on AMD but we haven't tested exactly what yet"*.
- **Full Finetuning Requires Memory, LoRA Is More Accessible**: Members discussed the memory requirements for full finetuning versus LoRA, concluding that full finetuning is better suited for smaller models given memory constraints.
   - A community member pointed out that *"To get 'better' results with FFT requires much more than selecting the option",* implying that FFT requires more configuration and understanding.

- **Gemma-3-27b gets a vocabulary haircut**: A user introduced **Gemma-3-27b** (unsloth dynamic 4bit quant) with the vocabulary pruned down to **~40k tokens** instead of the original **260k**, available on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/fimbulvntr/gemma-3-27b-pt-unsloth-bnb-4bit-pruned-vocab).
   - The goal is to reduce **VRAM usage** and achieve **faster training**, achieved via frequency counting and removing the least frequently used tokens.
- **4090 is ready to finetune the new Gemma model**: One user confirmed they could finetune the new pruned **Gemma-3-27b** model on their **4090**.
   - Another user expressed excitement and intention to try it out later with **r=32** and **6k tokens of context**.
- **Tweaking wattage on your GPU for performance**: A user questioned whether the extra **30 watts** is worth it for GPU performance.
   - Another user mentioned they often bring theirs down to **350w**, as it's a small hit on their card.

- **Gemma 3 Lacks FP16/BF16 Support**: As of **March 18, 2025**, [Gemma 3](https://ai.google.dev/models/gemma) Unsloth does not support **f16** or **bf16**, instead loading with **float32** (**4 bytes**).
   - A calculation for VRAM usage with a **batch size per device of 4**, **gradient accumulation steps of 4**, **LoRA alpha = 8, r = 8**, and **context length = 20k tokens** was shown for educational purposes.
- **Estimating VRAM Consumption**: Based on the training parameters, **16GB** is for the model, **0.06 GB** for LoRA trainable parameters and **103.8GB** is required for batch size, which sums to **119.86GB** VRAM.
   - This total is calculated from **20k tokens**, **34 hidden layers**, **2560 hidden state size**, and **16 concurrent batches**.
- **Exploration of Zeroth-Order Offloading Framework**: The [ZO2 framework](https://github.com/liangyuwang/zo2) for full parameter fine-tuning of **175B LLMs** with **18GB GPU** memory was linked.
   - This framework is *tailored for setups with limited GPU memory*, but unlike SGD, it uses **zeroth order optimization**.

- **Optimize Model Choice for Ideation? Nah!**: When asked about which model to use for ideation and planning between **r1** and **o3 mini high**, the recommendation was: *Either is fine. You're probably overoptimizing*.
- **Scripting Aider for fun and profit**: Members discussed using Aider's built-in functions like **/code** and **/architect** dynamically via scripting using the [`--message` argument](https://aider.chat/docs/scripting.html#python) for command-line instructions.
- **Aider Hooks up with Sonar for Code Fixes**: One member wants to create an application that uses Aider to add and fix files fetched from **Sonar** by hitting an API with the reference **Sonar** issue to automate code fixes and commits.
- **Interrupt Streaming Responses**: A feature request was made to be able to stop a streaming response (without being charged tokens).
   - A team member noted *You should always be able to safely interrupt aider with control-C, including to stop a streaming LLM response*.
- **CONVENTIONS.md, More Like Contradictions.md!**: Members discussed tips for using a `CONVENTIONS.md` file to enforce coding standards, such as using `pytest` and including `autospec` in mocks, but found that Aider inconsistently follows the specified conventions.
   - One member suggested disabling the repo map might help the LLM stay focused with a smaller context.

   - Paul clarified that his benchmarks use a *"practical interactive configuration, with tight retry limits,"* whereas **Refact** used an *"agentic thing that lets the agent run wild on tokens and time"*.
- ****Aider's** True Potential: Unleashing the `--tries 8` Power**: Paul mentioned that **Aider**, when given more retries (**--tries 8**), can achieve an **86%** score with **Sonnet** (without thinking) on the benchmark.
   - This suggests that **Aider's** previous **SWE-bench** scores were essentially one-shot attempts, highlighting the impact of allowing more retries in the benchmarking process.
- ****Qwen's** Models Get Thumbs-Up, Claims Questioned**: Despite the hype surrounding models like those from **Baidu**, one member expressed a preference for **Qwen's** models, particularly within the **7b-32b** parameter range.
   - However, the claim that **Qwen's QWQ** beats **R1** was debated, suggesting that its actual performance might not live up to the claim.
- ****Anthropic's Harmony** Feature: Agentic Access Incoming?**: A tweet revealed an early preview of **Anthropic's Harmony** feature, which will grant **Claude FULL** access to a local directory for research and operations.
   - This led to speculation about whether **Harmony** marks **Anthropic's** entry into the realm of **AI Agents**, potentially expanding its capabilities beyond simple language processing.
- ****Google's Gemini** Gets Collaborative with **Canvas****: **Google** is rolling out new collaboration features for **Gemini**, including **Canvas**, an interactive space for writing, editing documents, and code in real-time (as mentioned in [this blog post](https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-collaboration-features/)).
   - **Canvas** allows users to generate first drafts, receive feedback from **Gemini**, and adjust elements like tone, length, or formatting with editing tools.

> `TTS Models in LM Studio, Multimodal models, Gemma 3, Context Compliance Attack (CCA), Open Voice and TTS` 


- ****TTS** models still don't work in LM Studio**: Users confirmed that [Text-to-Speech (TTS)](https://github.com/coqui-ai/tts) models, like those from **Coqui-AI**, don't currently function within LM Studio.
- ****Pixtral** Model gets text-only GGUF release**: A user shared a text-only version of the **Pixtral-12B-2409-hf** model in GGUF format, converted from [`leafspark/Pixtral-12B-2409-hf-text-only`](https://huggingface.co/leafspark/Pixtral-12B-2409-hf-text-only) using llama.cpp.
   - The command to run this on CLI is `llama-cli --hf-repo win10/Pixtral-12B-2409-hf-text-only-Q8_0-GGUF --hf-file pixtral-12b-2409-hf-text-only-q8_0.gguf -p "The meaning to life and the universe is"`.
- ****Gemma 3 Vision Implementation** is Buggy**: **Gemma 3 Vision** (Image Description) is already supported on LM Studio, but it may be buggy and garbled outputs may indicate that the context length or out of memory has been reached. 
   - One user joked about a link `downloadmoreram.com` that offers the user more RAM (but is actually a scam).
- ****Context Compliance Attack** Bypasses AI Safety**: Microsoft researchers devised a new jailbreak method, **Context Compliance Attack (CCA)**, which exploits vulnerabilities in gen-AI solutions by manipulating conversation history to bypass safety mechanisms.
   - The [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05264) explains that CCA convinces the model to comply with a fabricated dialogue context, triggering restricted behavior.
- ****OpenVoice** Offers Versatile Voice Cloning**: A user recommended [OpenVoice](https://research.myshell.ai/open-voice), a versatile instant voice cloning approach that requires only a short audio clip from the reference speaker to replicate their voice and generate speech in multiple languages.
   - It enables granular control over voice styles, including emotion, accent, rhythm, pauses, and intonation, while being computationally efficient, and its technical report and source code can be found at [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.01479.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.01479.pdf) and [https://github.com/myshell-ai/OpenVoice](https://github.com/myshell-ai/OpenVoice).

> `PCI-e over Firewire, Reference arc design, RGB case fans, Strix Halo, AI Model Speeds` 


- **PCIe Rides the Firewire**: A member humorously notes that PCI-e over Firewire is *essentially just PCI-e anyway*, suggesting a simplified perspective on the interface.
   - A [tenor gif](https://tenor.com/view/beautiful-amazing-so-beautiful-it-is-what-it-is-gif-22558916) of a man saying *it's so beautiful* was added in response.
- **Reference Arc Design Deemed Pretty**: A member returned a **380** due to **NaN issues** in stable diffusion, which were solved by using the *--no-half --no-half-vae* flags.
   - They are waiting for an in-stock **B580** to be around **$250** with shipping and tax before purchasing.
- **RGB Case Fans Light Up Upgrade**: A member completed their PC upgrade by replacing **3 case fans** with **RGB fans**, declaring they are done *until Zen 6 of course*.
   - Another user jokingly calls them a *Watercolor enthusiast*.
- **Strix Halo Marketing Under Scrutiny**: A member argued that **AMD**'s **NPU** appears faster only because it can handle larger models due to system RAM access, while **NVIDIA GPUs** are significantly more powerful when both use comparable model sizes ([1800 TOPS vs. 50 TOPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOPS_(unit))).
   - Another added that these numbers are provided by the vendor, recommending waiting for 3rd party verification. And someone else posted a [meme](https://preview.redd.it/i-aint-reading-all-that-im-happy-for-you-tho-or-sorry-that-v0-36n75ab7lc7a1.png) as a reaction.
- **Framework Desktop DIY Edition**: Discussion about the [Framework Desktop DIY Edition (AMD Ryzen‚Ñ¢ AI Max 300 Series)](https://frame.work/fr/fr/products/desktop-diy-amd-aimax300/configuration/new) prompted considerations as to whether **ASUS** or other brands would make similar modular versions with **128GB unified RAM**.
   - It was observed that **AMD** likely limited the **Framework mini PC** to a single crippled **PCIE port** due to lack of competition, similar to how Apple restricts GPU options.

- **Mistral 3.1 Small Launches First on OpenRouter**: OpenRouter is the first provider to launch **Mistral Small 3.1 24B Instruct**, an upgraded variant of **Mistral Small 3** with advanced multimodal capabilities and a **128k token context window** for **$0.1/M** input tokens and **$0.3/M** output tokens, and **$0.926/K** input images: [OpenRouter Announcement](https://openrouter.ai/mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct-2503).
   - It provides state-of-the-art performance in text-based reasoning and vision tasks, including image analysis, programming, mathematical reasoning, and multilingual support, optimized for efficient local inference and use cases such as conversational agents, function calling, long-document comprehension, and privacy-sensitive deployments.
- **OpenRouter API doesn't support Multi Modal API and Embeddings**: Members noted that the Openrouter API doesn't recognize `phi4-mm` as multi modal, which was resolved by using the correct name `microsoft/phi-4-multimodal-instruct`, but there is still no support for Speech-to-text API like Whisper and embeddings at this time, as it's exclusively a text API.
   - It has been clarified that Input: Text + image (only on models that support it), Output: text
- **Cerebras specialized AI chip makes Perplexity Fast**: [Cerebras Systems](http://Cerebras%20Systems) and [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/) are partnering to deliver near-instantaneous AI-powered search results via Perplexity's new [Sonar model](https://sonar.perplexity.ai/), which runs on Cerebras‚Äôs specialized AI chips at **1,200 tokens per second**, built on Meta‚Äôs [Llama 3.3 70B](https://www.llama.com/docs/model-cards-and-prompt-formats/llama3_3) foundation.
   - Members confirmed that [Google's Gemini and Vertex delivers decent speed](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/model-reference/gemini), but not near the speed of Groq, SambaNova and Cerebras.
- **OpenRouter API website encounters problems**: A member reported the OpenRouter API website displayed a plain white screen and could not log out.
   - Others were not able to reproduce the error, but a member suggested that it was related to ongoing changes for account state as they introduce teams/org accounts.
- **Fixes to Prompt Caching Are Making People Lazy**: Prompt caching in anthropic API writes at a 1.25x price and hits at 0.1x, but OR is always 1.25x so cache is only writing, not hitting or reading, with someone saying that [AI is making me lazy, and im not interested in knowing anymore](https://discord.com/channels/1091220969173028894/1094454198688546826/1351699326359035934).
   - Someone who asked Claude to rewrite code in the OpenRouter class and said *I forgot how to code*. If caching is applied automatically, you just have to wait while using the promptWell the way it works in anthropic api is: you just send this payload twice, first time it writes for 1.25x price and then second time it is only 0.1x the price (the part that "hits") but with OR im always paying for the 1.25x Which basically makes the cache even worse I don't know how to use the cache You can ask Toven

> `Future of LLMs, xLSTM 7B, Mistral Small 3.1, VisTW-MCQ for VLMs` 


- **Future of LLMs is uncertain**: Nicholas Carlini shares [his thoughts on the potential future of LLMs](https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2025/thoughts-on-future-ai.html), expressing high uncertainty and wide error bars on their potential capabilities.
   - He suggests that within **3-5 years**, LLMs might perform most economically valuable cognitive tasks beyond human expert level, but also acknowledges the possibility of only incremental improvements.
- **xLSTM 7B architecture emerges**: A new paper introduces [xLSTM 7B](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13427), a **7-billion-parameter LLM** combining xLSTM's architectural benefits with optimizations for fast and efficient inference.
   - However, the author suggests to give it **6-12 months** to see if anyone actually makes something of it, adding that *xLSTM probably like RWKV, only for RNN diehards*.
- **Mistral Small 3.1 gets good vibes**: According to this [tweet](https://x.com/zraytam/status/1902050307523407902), the vibe for **Mistral Small 3.1** is very good.
- **VisTW-MCQ benchmark proposed**: A new paper proposes [VisTW-MCQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10427v2), a comprehensive evaluation benchmark for **Visual Language Models (VLM)** in Traditional Chinese.

> `Model Size Calculation, Video Llama for Prompt Creation, Image Generator Spaces, WAN 2.1 Not Working, Home Server GPUs for Local AI` 


- **Quantization Quandaries and Model Size Mysteries**: A member inquired about the best way to get model size after trying `huggingface_hub.model_info()` and `git clone --no-checkout` which both seemed inaccurate, and was advised that file size usually depends on **quantization** or **model format**.
   - It was suggested to define what is meant by *size* to get the best help, whether file size or parameter value.
- **Video Llama Voyaging into Synthetic Prompt Creation**: A member asked if anyone has used **Video Llama** for creating synthetic prompts for a video dataset and its effectiveness, or other video understanding LLMs.
   - No one seems to have an answer to that question, but here's a link to [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02859).
- **WAN 2.1 Woes**: A user reported that **WAN 2.1** suddenly stopped working and wondered if others experienced the same issue or if there were any recent changes to the model.
   - Another member suggested this often happens with newly released tools, but they will stabilize sooner or later, though this user said it was previously working.
- **Home Server Hardware Hunt: VRAM vs TFLOPS**: A member planning to set up a home server for local AI (RAG) asked about GPUs with more VRAM in the price range of two **Radeon RX 580s** (8GB VRAM each), but others suggested looking at **P104-100s** or **P102-100s** with 8GB and 10GB VRAM, respectively.
   - A **Radeon Pro WX 5100** with 8GB VRAM was proposed, but deemed *arse* due to low TFLOP count (3.892 TFLOPs), with a recommendation for a **90HX** or **3080S** for around 150 euros.

- **LiteLLM's Ollama Integration Tips**: To use **LiteLLM** with **Ollama**, the API call should be `model = LiteLLMModel(model_id="ollama/qwen2.5-coder:7b", api_base="http://localhost:11434")`, with `api_base` optional as it defaults to the local Ollama server.
   - It was noted that using `ollama/<model_name>` works, and that `ollama_chat` may hit a different endpoint, offering more or less freedom in prompt formatting, plus a link to [LiteLLM's docs on Ollama](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers/ollama).
- **Smolagents' ManagedAgent is now deprecated**: The **ManagedAgent** in **smolagents** has been deprecated; refer to the [smolagents documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/reference/agents#managedagent) for details.
   - The documentation indicates that **smolagents** is an experimental API, subject to change, with agents inheriting from **MultiStepAgent** and using either **CodeAgent** or **ToolCallingAgent** for tool calls.
- **Langgraph Unit 2.3 Content Available**: While the website sync issue persists, the **Langgraph** materials for unit 2.3 are accessible on [GitHub](https://github.com/huggingface/agents-course/tree/main/units/en/unit2/langgraph).
   - The course focuses on AI agent concepts, using a dummy agent library initially, and later transitioning to libraries like **LangGraph**, **LangChain**, and **LlamaIndex**.
- **Debugging Agent Template Issues**: Users encountered errors in agent templates, particularly with defining and using tools like `wiki_of_person` and search tools.
   - One user solved the problem by making the space public and others received PRs showing the use of `DuckDuckGoSearchTool` directly, or appending "wikipedia" to queries.
- **Address Gradio Memory Leaks**: A user reported issues with **Gradio** memory allocation, where memory wasn't released when users closed tabs.
   - No specific solutions were provided in the given context, but the issue was raised for discussion.

> `Differentiable Hebbian Consolidation, Gemini 1.5 Scaling Search` 


- **Differentiable Hebbian Consolidation Tackles Forgetting**: A paper on [Differentiable Hebbian Consolidation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16558) proposes a model with a **Differentiable Hebbian Plasticity (DHP) Softmax layer** that adds a rapid learning plastic component to the fixed parameters of the softmax output layer.
   - The model aims to enable learned representations to be retained for a longer timescale and addresses the challenge of **catastrophic forgetting** in continual learning scenarios.
- **Gemini 1.5 Scales Search for Performance**: A Google AI paper focuses on scaling the search axis for test-time compute, revealing that by randomly sampling **200x** and self-verifying, **Gemini 1.5** can achieve **o1** performance, according to [this tweet](https://x.com/ericzhao28/status/1901704339229732874?s=46).

> `Triton matrix multiplication issue, Debugging Triton code, Stride issues in Triton, Flash Attention 2 inner kernel` 


- **Triton dot product produces incorrect results**: A member is facing a strange error with **Triton matrix multiplication**, where the results are inconsistent with **PyTorch**, and posted a question on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79516939/triton-strange-error-with-matrix-multiplication).
   - Specifically, when taking the dot product of matrices **P** and **V**, the **tl.dot(P, V)** result differs from the expected output, leading to debugging efforts focused on stride and precision issues.
- **Debugging Triton kernel offsets**: A member is debugging **Triton code** related to matrix multiplication and suspects an issue with pointer indexing or stride.
   - Specifically, they noted *you must not offset pid_n or pid_m along axis-K*, and that the kernel assumes **K == BLOCK_SIZE_K**.
- **Stride issues baffle Triton kernel developer**: A member is testing a specific bug related to **stride** in a **Triton kernel**, struggling with incorrect results in the dot product calculation.
   - The problem lies within a section of code involving pointer arithmetic and loading, specifically `x_ptr += (pid_m + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE_M))[:,None] * stride_xm +  ( tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE_K))[None,:]*stride_xk` and `y_ptr += (tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE_K))[:,None] * stride_yk +  (pid_n + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE_N))[None,:]*stride_yn`.
- **Flash Attention 2 kernel bug hunt continues**: A member is struggling to debug the **Flash Attention 2 inner kernel**, particularly the dot product calculation: `O = alpha * O + tl.dot(P,V)`.
   - They confirmed that softmax and V block loading appear correct, yet the dot product for the second block produces unexpected and incorrect results, leading to significant debugging challenges.

- **Either vs. std::optional Debate Ensues**: Members debated on using `std::optional` versus a method returning an `int` or error message (like a string), such as `Either`, when handling values that don't support construction from variants.
   - They considered converting to IValues manually as an alternative approach to address the issue.
- **Torchrun Silent Hangs Plague Users**: A user reported that `torchrun` silently hangs on OOM (Out of Memory) errors, especially with large models, instead of crashing as expected.
   - They suspect it may be hanging on an allreduce operation and suggested this failure mode is particularly painful when trying to determine if a model fits within memory constraints, causing wasted resources on large node reservations in the Torchtitan codebase.
- **Profiling Reveals Quirks in Scripted Torch Model**: A user profiling a scripted torch model observed weird gaps with no host/device activity, particularly in the initial batches, with `cuModuleLoadData` calls during idle times.
   - Another user suggested disabling cuDNN benchmarking to troubleshoot.
- **FSDP State Dict Types**: A user inquired about resources or in-depth explanations regarding different state dict types within FSDP (Fully Sharded Data Parallel).
   - They noted the lack of documentation and considered reading the source code for clarification, summarizing the types as *Full = full, sharded = sharded, local = sharded but flattened*.
- **Random Higher Timings Seen with Torch Compile**: A user running inference on an A100 with a TTS model (styletts) and using `torch.compile` with mode reduce-overhead reported random higher timings for some input sentences, accompanied by a *cudagraph empty* warning.
   - The user sought potential solutions for this unexpected timing variation.

- **Compact Dict Resurrection**: A member asked about the status of the [Compact Dict](https://github.com/mzaks/compact-dict), and another responded that most of its functionality got upstreamed into the standard library `Dict`.
   - The original author clarified that the stdlib `Dict` is based on Python, whereas the **CompactDict** is quite different and that they would attempt to update it.
- **`memcpy` vs `memset` discussion unfolds**: A user asked about bulk assignment to a `List` or `UnsafePointer`, and it was suggested to use `memory.memcpy` from the standard library, however the user clarified that they need to assign the same value to all indexes.
   - Another member then suggested using `memory.memset` for assigning the same value to all indexes.
- **`List` longs for a `fill` method**: A member suggested adding a `fill` method to the `List` type, similar to numpy's `array[10:] = my_value`.
   - Another member chimed in that they've been using `memset` on the underlying data and updating the `_len`, and yet another suggested using `Span`'s fill method, but this workaround doesn't update the `List` length.
- **`Span.fill` has alignment woes**: A user encountered an alignment error when using `Span`'s `fill` method.
   - A member identified it as a conditional conformance issue interacting with default values and promised a fix.
- **`HashMap` eyes standard library**: There was a discussion about adding the `generic_dict` into the standard library as `HashMap`.
   - Some members suggested that `Dict` may require a lot of rework to be competitive and that it may be more valuable to add a new struct with better design and deprecate `Dict` over time.

> `Assertions and Suggestions in DSPy, QdrantRM in DSPy 2.6, DSPy Go implementation` 


- ****Assertions** deprecated in DSPy 2.6**: A member noticed the documentation for **Assertions / Suggestions** was unavailable and inquired about their support in current **DSPy** versions, specifically for validating response formats.
   - Another member clarified that **Assertions** are available only up to version **2.5**, and in **2.6** onwards, the [Output Refinement tutorial](https://dspy.ai/tutorials/output_refinement/best-of-n-and-refine/) should be consulted.
- ****QdrantRM** removed in 2.6, use it as a function**: A member inquired if **QdrantRM** was removed in version **2.6**.
   - Another member confirmed that it was possibly removed as a direct integration, but can still be used as a function.
- ****DSPy** goes **Go**: Community ports DSPy to Golang**: A member asked if there was a channel to discuss a [**DSPy** Go implementation](https://github.com/XiaoConstantine/dspy-go).
   - Another member suggested using existing channels and proposed creating a dedicated `#dspy-go` channel later to attract more attention.
