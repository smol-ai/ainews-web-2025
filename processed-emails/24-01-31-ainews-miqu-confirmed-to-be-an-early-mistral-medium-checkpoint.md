<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->> AI Discords for 1/30/2024. We checked **21** guilds, **311** channels, and **7688** messages for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **577 minutes**.

There's been a lot of speculation about the surprisingly good open access (not open source, because no license) model Miqu - scoring 74 on MMLU (vs 75 for mistral-medium) and 84.5 on EQ-bench, a subjectively better version of MMLU. There've been a lot of debates [both for](https://twitter.com/teortaxesTex/status/1752673893276356608) and [against](https://twitter.com/nisten/status/1751841882831716578) this fact - but [the CEO of Mistral](https://x.com/intrstllrninja/status/1734301196402184574?s=20) has now come out and confirmed it.
