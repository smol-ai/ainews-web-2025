> - `Triton Code Limitations with GROUP_M`
> - `GemV Implementation Challenges`
> - `Memory-Bound Performance Analysis` 


- **Performance Insights on Batch Sizes**: Up to batch size **16-32**, the speed-up remains consistent as it utilizes 1 **16x16** / **8x32** tensor core instruction, but slows down afterwards while maintaining close to **1x** at higher batch sizes.
   - Mobicham noted that with more autotune parameters, there's potential for improved speed.
- **Autotune Configurations from PyTorch**: A member shared **extra autotune configs** found in the PyTorch repository, useful for **int8 mm** challenges.
   - These configs can potentially aid Mobicham's performance tests, particularly in optimizing tensor core usage.
- **Triton Code Limitations with GROUP_M**: Mobicham indicated that reducing **GROUP_M** below **8** could negatively affect performance due to restrictions in `tl.dot` supporting only specific tensor core shapes.
   - The assertion error received when using lesser shapes highlights the challenge in achieving efficient implementations.
- **GemV Implementation Challenges**: After struggling with a good **gemv** implementation in Triton, Mobicham switched to **CUDA**, leading to the development of **GemLite**.
   - Testing showed that using multiply + add was feasible, but ultimately, performance was subpar compared to using `tl.dot`.
- **Memory-Bound Performance Analysis**: The performance when using advanced configuration settings remains slower in **memory-bound setups** yet achieves speeds close to **FP16** with large batches.
   - This is particularly beneficial for large context prefill and training, indicating effective overall progress.

- **Compile errors when using PyTorch 2.4**: Members reported compile errors with the latest main on PyTorch 2.4, especially issues with fake tensors. It was noted that using `os.environ['TORCH_COMPILE_BACKEND'] = 'aot_eager'` might hide these errors in CI.
   - One member suggested a potential CI issue regarding testing with the default backend, hinting at a need for CI workers to install a newer version of gcc.
- **Performance impact of input padding**: One member did a test run with input padding using the default config on the Alpaca dataset and found a significant speed hit. They noted that while memory footprint improved due to less fragmentation, the performance optimization was not as beneficial.
   - Another member suggested that reporting both padded and unpadded tokens could provide insights into the waste from padding, emphasizing that padded tokens are still processed.
- **Memory footprint considerations**: Discussion about memory management led to insights on better memory footprint and implications for OOM issues during training. Using expandable segments did not seem to resolve memory hikes for larger sequence lengths.
   - Members highlighted that reserved memory is crucial for avoiding OOM, and one noted a bump in memory likely corresponds with increases in sequence length.
- **Need for CI testing standards**: There was a suggestion to open a separate issue regarding CI testing for torch.compile with the default backend due to inconsistent error reporting. This topic has since been revisited in the context of existing GitHub issues.
   - Engagement around CI standards included discussion about setting up an environment to better reproduce issues faced with PyTorch versions.
