> `Meta Model Safety Downgrades, Decoding 'venom' Prompts, Gemini 2.5 Pro's 'Aliveness', New LMArena models` 


- **Meta Models Get a "Safety" Downgrade**: Newer models from Meta are reportedly becoming *safer*, with one member noting the shift by testing how the AI infers hidden context from corrupted text and observing that the models now apparently sanitize the **censored details**.
   - In contrast, previous models like **Themis**, **Cybele**, and **Spider** were *eager to go where other models couldn't*.
- **Decoding the "Venom" Prompt: A System Prompt Analysis**: Members analyzed the system prompt for models like **Spider**, **Cybele**, and **Themis**, believing they share a similar prompt to the now exposed [`venom`](https://gist.github.com/riidefi/3340cc2b33b9edf5f03dc4429ba635d0) prompt.
   - The analysis reveals a *whacky but intelligently crafted* prompt that heavily influences the models' style and responses, particularly in how they format and structure their outputs.
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro's Spooky "Aliveness" Sparks Turing Test Debates**: Members express intrigue over the *aliveness* and *curiosity* of **Gemini 2.5 Pro**, with one suggesting it *might be the first to pass a serious Turing Test* due to its unique interaction style.
   - They highlight **Gemini's** exceptional creative writing capabilities and top scores on **Philip's SimpleBench** as evidence of its potential and note the model appears to be more creative and engaging, leading to calls for a double-blind **Turing Test**.
- **LMArena Introduces a Pantheon of New Models**: LMArena introduces a flood of anonymous models like **Aether**, **Maverick**, **Ray**, **Stargazer**, **Riveroaks**, with members trying to uncover their origins and capabilities.
   - **Stargazer** is said to be made by Google (=== **Nebula**), and  **Riveroaks** claims to be from OpenAI, gpt 4o, while **Maverick**, **Spider** and **24_karat_gold** seem to have a similar style due to their shared system prompts and origins at Meta.

> `Blackwell Support, VLM Training, GRPO Usage, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Training with Unsloth` 


- **RTX Pro 6000 gets PyTorch Support**: A user asked about **Blackwell support** and mentioned having an **RTX Pro 6000** with **CUDA 12.8** and **sm_120** to finetune **Mistral**.
   - Another user replied that PyTorch nightly supports it, but recompiling everything is required.
- **RAG Reward Ruminations**: A user asked about using **GRPO** for **RAG** or similar variants with tools, and how to reward that.
   - Another user outlined primary reward components, including **retrieval quality rewards** (relevance, diversity, accuracy), **generation quality rewards** (factual consistency, citation accuracy, completeness), and **tool usage rewards** (appropriate selection, correct usage, effective incorporation).
- **Unsloth's Training Precision Pointers**: In a discussion about training speed and precision, it was stated that **16-bit LoRA** is the most precise and fastest if **VRAM** is not limited, and that **Unsloth** has optimizations for 16-bit.
   - It was also suggested to benchmark both **4-bit** and **8-bit** to see the difference and gain practical experience.
- **Multi-GPU Marvels Incoming**: It was revealed that multi-GPU support is coming soon to **Unsloth**.
   - The first release will likely include only data parallelism, and fsdp (Fully Sharded Data Parallelism) may not be included initially and will be under the AGPL3 license.
- **DeepSeek Training Trials**: One member lamented that they *can't train on deepseek!*
   - It may require two nodes of **H100s** to train **DeepSeek**, even with **QLoRA**.

> `Lightweight Pretraining Techniques, Bonsai pretraining, BitNet training Costs, Qwen Model Rebenched, Exllama2 vs vLLM Inference` 


- **Investigating SOTA Lightweight Pretraining for 64-GPU alternative**: A member suggested investigating **SOTA lightweight pretraining techniques** (MoE, FP8) to achieve pretraining with a single node in a couple of weeks instead of 64 GPUs.
   - They shared a [link to deepgrove-ai/Bonsai](https://github.com/deepgrove-ai/Bonsai) suggesting it might be possible to pretrain with *only $70 and 3.8b tokens on a BitNet*.
- **DeepGrove's Bonsai Claims $70 BitNet Pretraining**: A member expressed skepticism about [DeepGrove's Bonsai](https://github.com/deepgrove-ai/Bonsai) claim of pretraining a **BitNet** with *only $70 and 3.8b tokens*.
   - They are running the model in Kaggle to see if it holds up and explore possibilities of the model being *a blindly copied Qwen model* or *continue trained Qwen to BitNet*.
- **BitNet Verification Challenges Explored**: A member shared a code snippet for a **modified weight quantization** to determine if a model is based on **BitNet** architecture.
   - The code uses per-tensor quantization to 1.58 bits, with no grouping needed for quantization.
- **Fastest inference engine debate: exllama2 vs vLLM**: A member asked about the fastest inference engine for single request non-batched decoding for Llama / Mistral 4bit quants, particularly comparing **Sglang/lmdeploy** and **vLLM**.
   - The member assumes **vLLM** might not perform well in non-batched decoding due to its engine needing to go through llm_engine.step().
- **TurboDerp's exllama2's Dynamic Mode Explored**: A member shared the [exllama2's dynamic mode link](https://github.com/turboderp-org/exllamav2/blob/master/doc/dynamic.md), noting all forward calls go through the generator, requiring control handoff to the generator job scheduling.
   - Other members suggest **TensorRT LLM** for single token generation, while some suggest *hooking the forward pass in exllama*.

> `Orpheus Dataset Issues, Model Evaluation Problems, Gemma 3 Inference Samples, Fine-tuning with PDFs, Vision Fine-tuning with Gemma 3` 


- **Dataset causes value error**: A user encountered a `ValueError: expected sequence of length 203 at dim 1 (got 885)` when using a custom dataset in **Unsloth Orpheus** format, later resolving it by using a GPU.
   - Another user mentioned that the **Orpheus dataset** uses **SNAC**, which operates at **24kHz**.
- **Model Evaluation Incoherence Surfaces**: A user reported experiencing issues during model evaluation, with the model generating incoherent text despite coherent text generation during normal inference runs.
   - It was suggested that enabling `report_to` can help log metrics to platforms like **Wandb**, especially when using a custom `compute_metrics` function.
- **Gemma 3 does Text-to-Image!**: A user asked for image and text inference samples for **Unsloth/Gemma 3** using Hugging Face, referencing a [Gemma 3 demo on Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface-projects/gemma-3-12b-it).
   - It was noted that while **Llama 3.2 Vision** requires an image, **Gemma 3** should not have the same issue.
- **Turning PDFs into Chatbots, Dataprep needed**: A user sought guidance on fine-tuning a model using only documents (PDFs) to specialize in a language or field, after converting the PDFs to text using **Langchain**.
   - It was suggested to use synthetic data generation via *augmentoolkit*, emphasizing that this process is outside the scope of **Unsloth** and that they should look at [Unsloth docs](https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/continued-pretraining).
- **Mamba Gains Eager Attention**: Users discovered a fix for **Mamba** implementation issues by setting `attn_implementation = "eager"`, as highlighted in a [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth/pull/2263).
   - Despite the fix, **Mamba** training was noted to be significantly slower.

> `Model Evaluation, Coding benchmarks, Long context benchmarks, Math benchmarks, Gemma 3 vs small LMs` 


- **General performance benchmarks non-existent**: A member stated that there is no such thing as general performance benchmark and every model is good/bad at a set of different verticals.
   - They said *it's like a fallacy to believe that by aggregating a bunch of verticals together you'll get a score result that satisfies your particular vertical*.
- **Coding benchmarks: Aider Polyglot and SWE Bench**: For coding benchmarks, a member suggested **Aider Polyglot** and **SWE Bench** as decently applicable benchmarks.
   - However, **SWE Bench** has issues with being based on llm frameworks, and **Aider Polyglot** might show how good an llm is when you use it with aider.
- **RULER is bare minimum for Long Ctx Bench**: For long ctx benches, a member stated that **RULER** is the bare minimum for what should be considered a long ctx bench, and **NIAH** is garbage.
   - They added that some of the recent ones are alright.
- **Math Benchmarks: AIME is good enough**: For math benchmarks, a member suggested that **AIME** is good enough as long as there's no contamination and there is proper assessment with COT.
   - They also mentioned that most coding benches are based on python, but there's **WebDev Arena** for JS.
- **Small LMs vs Gemma 3**: A member expressed interest in comparing **Gemma-3 4B** with existing small LMs.
   - They asked if **Open LLM** doesn't have **Gemma 3**, are there any other viable leaderboards containing **Gemma 3** against small LMs.

> `Space Instructions limitations, Image generation discontinued?, Apple Intelligence in the EU, Samsung AI vs Apple Intelligence, GPT Omni shortcomings` 


- **Space Instructions offer limited control, members discover**: Users discussed that [**Space Instructions**](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/space-instructions-limitations-FuW7yKXsTQGFp71t55f1Bg) in Perplexity AI do not provide full control over the search experience, mainly affecting output summarization rather than initial data sourcing.
   - The limitation means instructions cannot prevent the AI from searching specific topics, as instructions only apply *after* the relevant data has already been extracted, causing frustration among some users.
- **Perplexity Image Generation: Missing in Action?**: A user inquired about the discontinuation of **image creation** within Perplexity, noting the feature's absence.
   - Another user suggested using the *web search* to find the generate option, but another confirmed that the function doesn't seem to appear for everyone, perhaps indicating phased rollout or feature testing.
- **Apple Intelligence Blocked from EU?**: A user casually noted *yey apple intelligence in the EU now*, implying availability, though without further elaboration.
   - Following the statement, others swiftly shifted the focus to discussing **Samsung AI**, with one user claiming it's superior, triggering a debate on the merits of each.
- **Perplexity Users Grumble About GPT Omni**: Users expressed dissatisfaction with **GPT Omni**, with one describing it as *suck ass* and questioning how to revert to a previous **GPT** version.
   - Another user explained that **Omni** is designed for smarter interaction with audio, video, and images, but has been *dumbed down* compared to **GPT-4** for cost reasons.
- **Rumors abound: Perplexity to launch more Deep Research**: A Perplexity team member hinted at an upcoming, *more powerful version* of **Deep Research** in the coming weeks.
   - Speculations include a potential partnership with **Groq**, following the addition of text, but not the actual new deep research feature; users report that **Deep Research** completes in seconds instead of minutes.

   - It's important to ensure you're using the official app to avoid scams and ensure you have access to **OpenAI** services.
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro Hits Rate Limits**: Users are reporting getting rate limited on **Gemini 2.5 Pro**, sparking discussion of whether the limit applies to both free and paid tiers, some users bypass rate limits by using a **VPN**.
   - It was suggested to use **Gemini** in [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/) where the limits are higher (50 per day).
- **Ghibli Style Conversions Tickle AI Image Generators**: Members experimented with prompts to convert images to **Ghibli** style, one user shared their prompt *"Make this image gibli style"*, while another suggested *"Reimagine this image in the iconic Studio Ghibli style: painterly textures, soft light, and a touch of nostalgic wonder"*.
   - The free models were used, but it was noted more improvements are needed to detail emotions and face details, with some claiming they are **far better than destroying Ghibli art style for nothing**.
- **ElevenLabs New Voice Model: Promising but Pricey?**: A member shared that they are exploring [ElevenLabs' new model](https://elevenlabs.io/) for creating narrated audio books, highlighting its voice cloning feature.
   - While impressed with initial results and high quality, they await **OpenAI** to release a similar voice product to avoid subscribing to external services, as for some game developers, it could be useful as a voice acting placeholder.
- **Navigating AI's Role in Creative Industries: a Tightrope Walk**: The discussion touched on the use of **AI** in creative fields, particularly gaming, with the consensus that **AI** is often used by non-creatives, resulting in amateurish outputs and overestimation of **AI's** current capabilities, they referenced [this discussion](https://discord.com/channels/974519864045756446/1355653770603925806).
   - There was an exchange of opinions, with some arguing that **AI** is mostly assisting professionals for ideation, while others critiqued reliance on statistically average outputs and the need for human effort in creating novel works. AI integration into existing software ecosystems like **Adobe** and **Autodesk** was seen as a more promising direction.

> `Image generation rate limits, copilot experiences, ChatGPT instructions, 4o abilities, future of image model` 


- **OpenAI implements image generation rate limits for Plus users**: Due to extreme load since the new image model was released, Plus users are now experiencing [rate limits](https://www.google.com/search?q=openai+rate+limits), an interim measure to mitigate the flood of users.
   - One user, presumably facetiously, remarked, *"At $200 a month you better not get rate limited,"* referencing a story that OpenAI added **1 million new users in an hour**.
- **Users adapt to copilot**: A member shared feeling adapting to copilot, when copilot is *"something dumb over and over"*.
   - The member expressed a feeling of adaptation while using **copilot**.
- **Users seeking guidance on ChatGPT Prompting**: A user sought help to prevent **ChatGPT** from adding *"cool or edgy"* concluding remarks to its descriptions.
   - Another member suggested a revised prompt, including the line: *"Do not add concluding remarks outside the direct scope of fulfilling the request based on the chosen purpose. Stick to the process."*
- **Experimenting photo editing with 4o abilities**: A user suggested a mode for editing photos or setting a custom vibe in **4o**, preloading context with a game of **20 questions** to narrow in on obscure human touches.
   - The idea suggests leveraging **4o's** ability to read between the lines for better follow-up requests and a personalized experience.
- **Debating the Future of Image Model Improvements**: A member asked whether OpenAI will continue to improve the image model or leave it for a few years, similar to what they did with **DALL-E**.
   - No concrete answers were provided, but the question sparks curiosity about OpenAI's future plans for image generation technology.

- **Custom Instructions Work in 'About Me' Box**: A member confirmed that extending custom instructions into the 'About Me' box works perfectly, as *information is information to the model*.
   - Another member noted that the model can figure out likely patterns in your intent and *runs with it*, even if the fields are split mid-sentence.
- **RAG-only context limits 'About me' Box**: A member questioned whether the 'About Me' box gets confined to some **RAG-only context-dependent space** and whether it's reliable for storing entire prompts.
   - They also mentioned having a ridiculous amount of memories and have tried to fit entire prompts into them, but it doesn’t seem very reliable. And that memory-stored prompts or personas do not activate without specifically requesting them.
- **Personalization May Not Always Be Evident**: A member shared examples of personalized model responses and noted that the first response may not always reflect their personalization.
   - They emphasized being very clear about what they want and don't want from the model, including specifications for tool usage and NPC behavior.
- **Model Learns To Reset Rigid Patterns**: A member shared a code snippet `FORMAT_RESET` to help models acknowledge when they've fallen into rigid patterns and rethink their approach.
   - The code encourages the model to analyze what format would better suit the response and completely rethink its approach without defaulting to templates.

> `Custom instructions in 'about me' box, Memory-stored prompts, Model Guessing vs Training, FORMAT_RESET for rigid patterns` 


- **About Me as Custom Instructions?**: A member asked if extending the custom instructions into the *about me* box works, and another member confirmed that it works perfectly because the model uses it as additional information to work with.
   - The model can figure out a likely pattern in your intent and runs with it, even if you split the field mid-sentence; there is no functional reason it wouldn’t work unless “about me” gets confined to some RAG-only context-dependent space.
- **Memory-stored prompts unreliable?**: A member noted they have a ridiculous amount of memories, and while they have tried to fit entire prompts into them, it doesn’t seem very reliable.
   - They can’t get **memory-stored prompts or personas to activate** without specifically requesting them, leading them to think the model is not actually seeing them most of the time or they are a much lower priority than where custom instructions are placed in the model context; [shared chat examples of prompt engineering and NPC generation](https://chatgpt.com/share/67eb2cb0-b41c-8011-abee-88bfe2abc478).
- **Model Guessing vs Training**: One member shared their process by presuming that the model either guesses a lot, leading to variation, OR it was trained to output in a typical pattern which was not specifically asked for, OR it is doing exactly what was asked for.
   - Conflicts are mandatory to find and fix, as they usually degrade the performance, particularly when the model is trained that *humans prefer X* but the user prefers otherwise.
- **FORMAT_RESET for rigid patterns!**: A member created a little thing for when you catch a model following a format/pattern you don't like/want, as a way to acknowledge that the model has fallen into rigid patterns and rethink its approach without defaulting to templates.
   - They provided a code snippet to tell the model ```FORMAT_RESET: Acknowledge you've fallen into rigid patterns, analyze what format would better suit your response, and completely rethink your approach without defaulting to templates.```

- **Gemma 3 Beats Gemini 1.5 Flash**: A member shared a comparison where [**Gemma 3 27B** outperforms **Gemini 1.5 Flash**](https://i.imgur.com/XbmTSd1.png) in several benchmarks, like MMLU-Pro and Bird-SQL.
   - Another member confirmed excellent results with Gemini 2.5 Pro, while another user used Gemini 2.5 Pro to produce the data, available free on [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/google/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25).
- **Qwen Coder 7B recommended!**: For coding on a system with a **4060 Ti** and **i5 12400F**, **Qwen Coder 7B** was recommended and available on [LM Studio's model page](https://lmstudio.ai/model/qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct), with suggestions to offload most of it to the GPU and also use Qwen Coder 14B or 32B.
   - Members emphasized that a local LLM would perform *much worse* than cloud alternatives like **ChatGPT** or **Deepseek**, but **Gemini 2.0 Flash** was considered a top performer, costing only $0.44 per 1M input tokens according to their [pricing documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing).
- **Copilot's Coding Critiqued!**: Members debated whether **AI assistance** in programming is beneficial, with one arguing that it *hurts more than helps* because the average user learns on *AI slop*.
   - Others disagreed, stating that **Copilot** works great for experienced developers, but one person claims the recommendations given are trusted too easily by the average user, in addition to concern that **copilot is trained on garbage code**.
- **One Parameter LLM Possible?**: In a lighthearted exchange, it was discussed that *a one-parameter LLM is possible but useless*, and one user indicated they *tried 656K but it can't chat though*.

- **Nvidia Drivers Crash After Extended Runtime**: A user reported **Nvidia driver instability** after running models for **10-12 hours**, requiring a driver reinstall to resolve performance issues.
   - The user clarified the issue was with the **Nvidia driver** itself, not the Windows OS, and sought to find if others experienced the same.
- **M4 Max gets Speed Boost vs 5090**: A user observed a **3.24x speedup** from **M4 Max** to **5090** after resolving crashing issues, which aligns with the **3.28x ratio** of their memory bandwidths when doing **QwQ 32B 4 bit quant comparisons**.
   - They're now seeing around **21 tok/s** on **M4 Max** and roughly **60 tok/s** on **5090** when testing **Gemma 3 32B q4**.
- **Mac Freedom of Context Size vs Nvidia Faster GPUs**: While **Nvidia GPUs** may be faster, users are leaning towards **Macs** for the *freedom to have more context size*.
   - The user highlighted that even though NVIDIA GPUs are faster, the *ability to use larger context sizes* is proving to be more useful.
- **Tenstorrent Wormhole results sought out in Discord**: A user inquired about performance results for the **Tenstorrent Wormhole (n150d and n300d)** within the Discord community.
   - They expressed interest in obtaining **TOK/s** metrics for these models, but there was no follow up.
- **Overflowing Context impacts LLM speed**: A user wondered what would happen if they could load the **context overflow** into the shared memory/system RAM while keeping the entire model in VRAM.
   - Another user noted that the **LLM needs all the context in VRAM** to generate the next token, because *for each token generated, all the context goes through the transformer blocks, again and again*.

- ****Gemini 2.5 Pro**: A Hot Mess of Highs and Hallucinations?**: Users are experimenting with **Gemini 2.5 Pro** and reporting mixed results with some models hallucinating/DC'ing while others are providing top-tier performance for coding tasks.
   - One user noted, *"Gemini is hallucinating / dc'd for me, same for you guys?"*, while another stated that the combination of **Gemini 2.5 Pro** and **DeepseekV3** is *"almost free and top tier."
- ****RateLimitError** Woes: Token Limits or Request Frequency?**: A user reported frequent **RateLimitErrors** when requesting summaries and clearing history, and was looking for solutions to automate this process.
   - Paul Gauthier clarified that the rate limit is likely based on the number of requests per minute or day, rather than the token count. One possible solution may be found [in this Github issue](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider/issues/2979#issuecomment-2613554537).
- **Dot Command Revolution: Aider's productivity hack?**: A user is trying to promote the use of **.dotcommands** as a productivity hack for developers, enabling them to automate tasks with single-line commands such as `.status` and `.next`.
   - The goal is to provide cognitive shortcuts optimized for clarity and specific functionality, but no one is using them. It has led to the quip *"THE DOT REVOLUTION IS HERE 🔥 Coders everywhere will want to try this one cool trick."
- ****F#**: Condolences or Kudos?**: A user mentioned rebuilding their app from Python into **F#**, prompting mixed reactions, including condolences and suggestions to *"use Haskell"*.
   - While the user explained they were working on ML projects, the community seemed skeptical about the choice of **F#** for such tasks.
- **Video Analysis: Beyond the Transcript**: A user inquired about **AI models' comprehension of videos**, wondering if they understand emotional impact or follow visual storylines beyond just processing transcripts.
   - One response indicated that *"Gemini's video understanding is 1 frame per second of the video fed into the model as an image."*

> `Temperature for coding, Stopping benchmarks, Aider with subdirectories, Aider local config, Model Summarization fails` 


- **The Coder's Icy Preference for Temperature**: Members discussed the optimal "temperature" for coding, with `0` being the popular choice in the channel.
   - A member asked for justification for this value, requesting *is it based on smth*?
- **Aider's Subtree Savior for Mono-Repos**: A member asked how to limit **aider** to a subdirectory of a monorepo, prompting a response to use the `--subtree-only` switch after changing to the desired directory.
   - This sets **aider** to ignore the repo outside the starting directory, though the asker noted the docs need updating and pointed to the [FAQ on large monorepos](https://aider.chat/docs/faq.html#can-i-use-aider-in-a-large-mono-repo).
- **Config Conundrums: Model Settings in Aider**: A member reported that specifying model names in a local **YAML** config file wasn't working as expected.
   - Despite the startup message showing the correct config settings, **aider** still defaulted to *anthropic/claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219* rather than the configured *deepseek/deepseek-chat*.
- **Linting Loops Launching with Aider**: A member inquired about running linters within **aider**, with another suggesting the use of `/run [npm|pnpm] run [lint|fix|whatever-command]` for a tight feedback loop.
   - Another member pointed to the [sample aider.conf.yml](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider/blob/3992681b84d1ec0cbc18657c5ca832c89d7e551c/aider/website/assets/sample.aider.conf.yml#L263) file for listing multiple linters.
- **Architect Model Results Get a Promotion**: A member sought a way to directly send a satisfactory response from the architect model to the editor model to conserve **2.5 Pro** shots.
   - The suggestion was to open a new **aider** instance with `--restore-chat-history` and a suitable editor configured, though the lack of a `--no-architect` flag was noted as an inconvenience.

> `Cosine Annealing LR, Mini-batch vs Batch, Gradient Accumulation, Stanford CS 25 Transformers Course, Category theory` 


- **Debate on Cosine Annealing Learning Rate (LR) Updates**: Discussion on whether **Cosine Annealing LR** is best updated after every **batch** or **sample**, with concerns raised about different samples receiving different training when updating after every sample.
   - The recommendation was to update after every **mini-batch**, ignoring the *exposure problem*, or attempting to fix it.
- **Mini-Batch vs Batch Jargon Jungle**: Members discussed the difference between **mini-batch** and **batch** in machine learning, with the distinction becoming increasingly blurred due to techniques like gradient accumulation and distributed training.
   - It was mentioned that a **mini-batch** is run before each optimizer step, while a **batch** is a set of unique data, but the term *batch size* refers to the size of the **mini-batch**.
- **Gradient Accumulation: Pro or Con?**: Members debated the merits of **gradient accumulation**, with one member recalling it being previously dismissed but now seeing potential advantages in the early stages of training to calibrate optimizer states.
   - Another member noted that **gradient accumulation** can be beneficial when network communications are slower than the compute, but otherwise, it is considered bad.
- **Stanford Launches CS25 Transformers Course to the Public**: Stanford has opened its **CS25 Transformers** seminar course to the public via Zoom, featuring discussions with researchers and covering topics from LLM architectures to creative applications.
   - The course includes lectures, social events, networking sessions, and a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/2vE7gbsjzA) for discussions, with past lectures available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rNiJRchCzutFw5ItR_Z27CM).
- **Category Theory: Reverse Engineering DL?**: Someone shared a [link](https://x.com/norabelrose/status/1907169483678212292) to a thought experiment on whether **category theory** could be the optimal language for reverse engineering deep learning.
   - The original post argued that neural networks have *embeddings, or meaningful patterns of neuron activation* rather than *representations*.

> `ACL Rebuttals, Deep Sets for Triangle Area, Comparing Language Model Embeddings, Relative Representations, Convergence of Representations in AI` 


- **Reviewers Get Nudged After Rebuttal Submission**: A member asked about sending an extra message to **ACL reviewers** the day after submitting a rebuttal and another member suggested it's reasonable if the rebuttal deadline is closing or if follow-up might take a few days.
   - The original poster planned to follow up that evening, with the deadline being Thursday.
- **Deep Sets Calculate Triangle Area, Yields Zero Insights**: A member shared a link to a paper titled *Deep Sets for the Area of a Triangle* ([arxiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22786)), which presents a polynomial formula for triangle area in **Deep Sets** form.
   - The abstract concludes that the project, motivated by questions about computational complexity of n-point statistics in cosmology, gained *no insights of any kind*.
- **Comparing Language Model Embedding Matrices**: A member inquired about methods for analyzing and proving the similarity of two language models trained with the same tokenizer but different dimensionality **embedding matrices**.
   - Suggestions included **relative representations**, **least squares mapping**, and comparing the leading entries of the eigenvalue decomposition of W^T W.
- **Relative Representations Proposed as Solution, But Maybe Not**: A member suggested **relative representations** ([arxiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15430)) as a potential solution for comparing language model embeddings, while also cautioning about their limited applicability.
   - They linked a paper discussing **cosine similarity inflation in neural representations** ([arxiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02053)) and further pointed out related works discussing whether **cosine** is the best way to assess similarity.
- **AI Representation Convergence, Plato Style**: A member linked a paper arguing that representations in AI models, particularly deep networks, are converging towards a **shared statistical model of reality**, akin to Plato's concept of an ideal reality ([arxiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07987)).
   - Others suggested using **CCA** or **SVCCA** to compare the embedding matrices, referencing papers on **Singular Vector Canonical Correlation Analysis** ([arxiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05806)) and **projection weighted CCA** ([arxiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05759)).

> `Debugger updates, SmolLM Evaluation Issues, Open LLM Leaderboard Normalization, Subtask Aggregation PR` 


- **Debugger Status remains vague**: Members requested updates on the debugger's progress, but the specific status remained unclear, with a member offering assistance by asking what branch the debugger was working on.
   - A member shared code modifications, suspecting they might be causing unnecessary load, and later reported fixing a bug related to the number of choices in questions, suggesting a PR submission.
- **SmolLM leaderboard evals return empty aggregate scores**: A member reported that aggregate scores for tasks like **leaderboard_bbh**, **leaderboard_math_hard**, and **leaderboard_musr** were empty in the results JSON when running leaderboard evaluations with **lm-eval** on **SmolLM-1.7B**.
   - They provided the command used and example output, noting that individual tasks reported numbers as usual, and linked to the [Hugging Face Dataset Card](https://huggingface.co/datasets/open-llm-leaderboard/HuggingFaceTB__SmolLM2-1.7B-details).
- **Non-standard Normalization on the Open LLM Leaderboard**: The discussion highlighted the use of a *non-standard normalization* method on the [Open LLM Leaderboard](https://open-llm-leaderboard-blog.static.hf.space/dist/index.html#reporting_a_fairer_average_for_ranking:_using_normalized_scores) for evaluating and comparing LLMs.
   - The normalization was introduced to address issues with optimized prompts and evaluation setups that inflate model scores.
- **Subtask Aggregation PR Adds Subtask Scores**: A member shared a [PR](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/pull/2867) adding subtask aggregation, copied from a Hugging Face fork, to address missing aggregate scores in tasks with subtasks.
   - Another member tested the PR, reporting that installing **lm_eval** via editable triggered an unrelated error, but the PR otherwise appeared to work as expected.

- **Bypassing DeepSpeed Launcher on NVIDIA DGX Cloud**: A member is pre-training **GPT-NeoX** on **NVIDIA DGX Cloud** but must bypass the default `deepy.py` launcher due to SLURM and SSH restrictions, using a custom script that leverages a hostfile and `torchrun`.
   - The member is using [this script](https://github.com/ameyagodbole/hubble-gpt-neox/blob/3dd12f3cdf78a29116d55d795f783f903cc284c0/deepy_simple.py) to perform argument parsing and launch `train.py`, and has questions regarding their approach.
- **Debating Direct `train.py` Execution**: A member asked if they could directly start `python train.py` with encoded `ds_config` and `megatron_config` arguments, and how to handle GPU process spawning without `torchrun`.
   - Another member confirmed this approach for manual bypassing, suggesting further modular refactoring to inject node-local processes that self-assign rank and detect GPU count, coordinating through principle rather than protocol.
- **Navigating DGX Cloud with Torchrun**: A user is using **torchrun** due to cluster restrictions and disabled SSH, referencing a comment and sample script from the [NVIDIA DGX Cloud documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx-cloud/slurm/latest/cluster-user-guide.html#example-pytorch-job).
   - They are seeking guidance on whether they are implementing their custom solution correctly and whether they have reinvented the wheel.

> `CUDA occupancy, GPU parallel processing, A100 thread limit, GRPO training with Qwen` 


- ****Debate sparks over maximum parallel threads on A100 GPUs****: A discussion arose regarding the calculation of the maximum number of threads that can run in parallel on an A100 GPU, with one member stating the number is **96 * 2048**.
   - Another member uses GeoHot's tool to test this hypothesis, showing that the practical limit on their A100 (96SM) GPU is **24576**, or **256 threads per SM** before performance degrades.
- ****Warp scheduling explained as a way to hide latencies****: The discussion clarified that while a GPU can have many concurrent threads, they may not all run truly in parallel due to resource limitations like register space and shared memory.
   - A member pointed out that GPUs use **oversubscription to hide latencies**, and context switches between warps are cheap (~1 cycle), unlike CPUs, adding threads above the limit for "parallel threads" does not necessarily increase runtime, or at least not significantly/measurably.
- ****Experiments in GRPO training with Qwen 0.5B Model****: A member shared that they have finished a GRPO training run with **Qwen 0.5B** (code instruct) on the GPUMODE kernel dataset, but the model didn't effectively generate Triton kernels.
   - They hypothesize that SFT to teach the model the basics of Triton implementation, followed by GRPO for refinement, will be more successful.

> `Disable autotune, Triton kernel` 


- **Disable Triton Autotune Temporarily**: A member asked for a way to disable autotune temporarily because their **Triton kernel** is called in two situations, where only one needs autotuning, and they are using the `triton.autotune` decorator.
   - Another member suggested using a **global variable** to turn autotune on/off and reload the module, or using autotune inside the kernel instead of as a decorator.
- **Global variable trick**: One member suggests turning autotune on/off using a **global variable** and reloading the module that contains the Triton kernel.
   - The other option is to use autotune inside the kernel, not as a decorator, which doesn't require reloading the module.

   - Another member suggested checking out **Unsloth's Discord** and linked to [Unsloth's LoRA Hyperparameters Guide](https://docs.unsloth.ai/get-started/beginner-start-here/lora-hyperparameters-guide).
- **SFTTrainer freezes mid-training**: A user reported that their **SFTTrainer** was hanging after truncating the training dataset, and it timed out after an hour.
   - A member suggested that the issue might be due to a lack of progress bar appearance and potential misconfiguration of **TrainingArguments** or **Trainer** settings.
- **CPU outruns GPU with stable_baselines3**: A user reported receiving a warning about running **PPO** on the **GPU** with **MlpPolicy**, suggesting it's primarily intended for the **CPU**, and linked to a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3/issues/1245).
   - The user was confused why the **CPU** might be faster than the **GPU** when running a **Multi-Layer Perceptron**.

> `Compiler Bug, Enums, Flex Attention, Float to String Algorithm, FlashAttention-2 in Mojo` 


- **Confusing Compiler Error Message Exposed**: A user reported a confusing error message when defining a method for a `Dataset` struct, suspecting a compiler bug, and provided a [GitHub issue link](https://github.com/modular/max/issues/4248).
   - Another user suggested the issue might be due to using `out self` instead of `mut self`, while acknowledging the compiler error message was still confusing.
- **Enum Updates Still MIA**: A user inquired about updates on **enums** in Mojo, but unfortunately, there are no updates available.
   - The response was a simple *"Sadly no. 🙃🙃🙃"*
- **MAXing FlexAttention Implementation**: A user asked about implementing **flex-attention** in Mojo and whether it's difficult, linking to a [PyTorch blog post on flex-attention](https://pytorch.org/blog/flexattention/).
   - It was suggested that implementing it as a custom op in MAX is possible and that Mojo on the GPU is close to CUDA, allowing control over memory movement, so *"unless you run into something that's a work in progress, MAX should be able to do more or less whatever you want."*
- **Float-to-String Algorithm Porting Disappoints**: A user ported a new **float to string algorithm** to Mojo, referencing the creator's CPPCon talk, but found it slower than the standard library's dragonbox implementation and shared a [link to the relevant code](https://github.com/bgreni/EmberJson/blob/main/emberjson/teju/__init__.mojo#L103).
   - The user noted that stringifying `canada.json` went from mid 30ms to low 40s, despite ripping the formatting from the standard library.
- **FlashAttention-2 Recipe Revealed**: A user shared a link to a recipe containing a version of **FlashAttention-2** in Mojo, emphasizing it was written for readability, not super-optimized performance, see [custom-ops-ai-applications](https://builds.modular.com/recipes/custom-ops-ai-applications).
   - Another link was provided to a recipe showing progressive optimization of matrix multiplication using Mojo's memory layout abstractions, see [custom-ops-matrix-multiplication](https://builds.modular.com/recipes/custom-ops-matrix-multiplication).
