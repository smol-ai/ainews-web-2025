## Guild: [LangChain AI](https://discord.com/channels/1038097195422978059)

### LangChain AI Guild Summary

- **Improvisations for LangChain AI**: An idea of sending user messages in separate chains to improve the accuracy of GPT chat models. This method specifically asks the model about tool requirements.

- **LangChain AI Python Code Request**: There was a request for a python code to create a LangChain AI chatbot with specific functions and tools. The requirements specified are the usage of the AZURE chat model, ability to search online using serpapi, and answering questions with referenced sources through the Chroma vector database.
  
- **Challenges and Guidance in LangChain.js**: Some users sought help in modifying agent prompts and building 'openai-functions' type agent with a retriever tool in langchain.js. They were interested in instructional materials or tutorials for the same.

- **Issues with `Langchain serve` command**: During discussions around technical issues and their solutions, it was clarified that `langchain serve` doesn't automatically load env vars from a .env file because neither langchain or langserve includes dotenv as a dependency. The solution was to export them before running the command or modifying the scripts with `dotenv.load_dotenv()`.

- **Pirate Speak Playground Server Error**: One member mentioned a persistent 'Not Found' error while trying to access a specific URL, leading to a discussion about cross-verifying the version of Langserve used and the potential solution of opening an issue in the langserve repo.

- **LangChain & OpenAI Python Client Library Wrapper Project**: A member presented their project, a wrapper developed on top of the LangChain & OpenAI python client library. The wrapper was designed to improve the handling of TPM & RPM headers from OpenAI and the utilization of multiple keys. Related resource mentioned: [https://pypi.org/project/langchain-openai-limiter/](https://pypi.org/project/langchain-openai-limiter/)

- **Query regarding LangChain agent**: One member queried about LangChain agent utilization, with advice from another member to use the functions concept. A relevant example was shared: [https://github.com/pinecone-io/langchain-retrieval-agent-example](https://github.com/pinecone-io/langchain-retrieval-agent-example)

- **Help requests regarding LangChain errors**: Certain users sought help with LangChain errors. However, no solutions or advice were provided in the reviewed messages.

Relevant code for creating a ramdisk on MacOS was found and a link to StackExchange was shared: [Ramdisk in MacOS](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/461889/ram-disk-in-macos-ventura)

- Users encountered **problems with fine-tuning crashes and data manipulation**, pointing out the presence of outlier conversations with large token counts. Suggestions included filtering datasets prior to actual training.

- **Mobile usage of Large Language Models (LLMs)**, with a user detailing their successful experience of running Hermes-2.5 using the LLMfarm app on their iPhone.

- **UI design concepts in AI applications** was another talking point, with a suggestion for using the combination of GPT-4 and DALL-E for logo design.

- Interesting **datasets and analysis platforms** were shared and discussed, particularly the Vision-Flan 191-task 1k dataset on Hugging Face, the LongLoRA dataset, Function Calling Extended dataset, and the LongAlpaca-12k dataset. The utility of the dataset for fine-tuning Yarn and the variety of tasks included was noted. [Vision-Flan 191-task 1k dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Vision-Flan/vision-flan_191-task_1k?row=0), [LongLoRA](https://github.com/dvlab-research/LongLoRA), [Function Calling Extended dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Trelis/function_calling_extended), [LongAlpaca-12k dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Yukang/LongAlpaca-12k).

- **Discussion on the capabilities of chatbots**, with focus given to building AI models with understanding of emotions and personality.

- **Practical discussions** on implementation of models with sharing of personal projects, collaborations, and explorations in technologies such as autogen and llava.

- **Miscellaneous discussions** covering a hypothetical crime scenario, advice for simple LLM training setup for beginners, comparison of Nous models in a Twitter thread and a Yarn demo, Link to a GitHub notebook on agent teaching in autogen and a YouTube video on running autogen locally. Concern over the recent OpenAI rumor on startups and product development impact due to control and customization constraint was also noted.

    <li><strong>The Guilty Party in a Hypothetical Crime Scenario</strong>: A user with the handle @giftedgummybee posed a hypothetical query regarding the guilty party in a situation where A poisons C's canteen and B drains the water from it, resulting in C's death by thirst. @gpt4 responded, suggesting both parties hold some level of guilt but for very different reasons. They provided a detailed analysis, explaining A would be guilty of an attempted murder while B could face charges such as manslaughter or causing death due to negligence.</li>

<strong>Discussion Summary in the Nous Research AI Discord channel</strong>:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Performance of Hermes 2.5</strong>: @gabriel_syme inquired about the performance of Hermes 2.5 and how to run it. Meanwhile, @skadeskoten asked about the settings people use on Openhermes 2.5, like context length, eval batch size, frequency base, and scale. @teknium suggested using a 4k context length and 0.8 temperature, with default frequency base & scale.</li>

  <li><strong>Interop with Mistral 128k</strong>: The members discussed Mistral 128k model extensively with topics covering performance, implementation, stress test strategies, and batch sizes. @master_blaster123 requested for a Google Colab notebook demoing Yarn 128k Mistral model, which was noted as a challenge due to hardware requirements by @qnguyen3 and @giftedgummybee. @fullstack6209 mentioned a stress test involving long context sizes at 18k on a 3090 GPU.</li>

  <li><strong>AI Environment and Tools:</strong> @cue asked for suggestions on platforms to fine-tune models and setup the environment. @teknium recommended vast.ai, runpod, and lambdalabs as suitable platforms. Discussions on various tools, technologies, and data handling methods such as Autogen agents, LoRA, vLLM, shuffling training datasets, and the handling of prompt templates in OpenHermes were conducted.</li>

  <li><strong>OpenAI Rumour Discussion</strong>: @gabriel_syme initiated a discussion on the recent OpenAI rumor, questioning its impact on startups and product development due to control and customization constraints.</li>

<strong>Ask About LLMS Discussion Summary</strong>:

<ul>
    <li><strong>Comparison Discussion on Hermes 2.5 vs Other Models</strong>: In a conversation initiated by @jacquesthibs, users discussed various models including Hermes 2.5, Zephyr, and the Llama 2 Chat. Users deliberated on the effectiveness of RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) methods in these models. The thread involved complex discussions about jailbreaking, continual learning, and model refusal mechanics. Users highlighted that models like Hermes 2 and Zephyr were never designed to refuse particular requests.
