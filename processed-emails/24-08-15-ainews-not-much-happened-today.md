**[Sponsored by Box] You have files. The files are full of nonsense. Box AI has an API that extracts useful metadata from the nonsense.** [See for yourself.](https://shortclick.link/tndo68)

> Swyx's comment: compared to [last week's sponsored post](https://shortclick.link/23g92m), this tutorial goes into metadata extraction from your Box items, aka structured data, and showing practical usecases for querying that metadata. All RAG eventually evolves into hybrid embedding + metadata queries, and Box's template approach is perhaps a more practical take on the JSONSchema API by the big labs.

> - `Llama 3.1`
> - `Grok-2`
> - `Aider Image Support`
> - `OpenRouter`
> - `Prompt Caching` 


- **Llama 3.1 Might Be Strong Second To DeepSeek**: Based on [OpenRouter data](https://openrouter.ai/models/meta-llama/llama-3.1-405b-instruct), Llama 3.1 might be the second best model for Aider, after DeepSeek.
   - However, conclusive results would require direct API usage data.
- **Grok-2 and Grok-2 Mini Released**: Grok-2 and Grok-2 mini were released in beta on 𝕏, and will be available through the enterprise API later this month.
   - Grok-2 is described as a significant step forward from Grok-1.5, outperforming Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4-Turbo on the LMSYS leaderboard.
- **Aider Supports Images For Some Models**: Aider can handle image files for models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
   - Users can add images to their chats using `/add <image-filename>`, `/clipboard`, or by launching Aider with the image filename on the command line.
- **OpenRouter Does Not Support Prompt Caching Yet**: OpenRouter does not support prompt caching, meaning that it does not save the prompts for future use.
   - This means that each prompt will be processed from scratch, even if it's the same as a previous prompt.
- **Aider's .aider Files Need To Be Present**: Aider creates files with the `.aider` extension to store configuration information.
   - These files should not be ignored by Git, as they are necessary for Aider to function properly. They can be ignored globally by adding `.aider*` to your global `.gitignore`.

- **Anthropic API gets prompt caching**: Anthropic has just rolled out prompt caching for its API, which cuts API input costs by up to 90% and reduces latency by up to 80%.
   - The feature works by caching frequently used prompts, similar to Deepseek's implementation, but Anthropic's implementation is faster and more efficient.
- **SB 1047 Amended**: The California Appropriations Committee passed SB 1047 with significant amendments that change the bill, particularly impacting the requirement for AI labs to submit certifications of safety test results.
   - AI labs will now be required to submit public statements outlining their safety practices, but the bill no longer imposes any criminal liability for those statements.
- **Impact of SB 1047**: The passing of SB 1047 with these amendments could have a significant impact on the entire AI ecosystem, including in the EU and Asia.
   - The bill aims to prevent AI disasters by implementing safeguards, but opponents argue that it could stifle innovation and hinder the development of AI.

> - `Mojo's Future`
> - `Mojo's Branding` 


- **Mojo's Future: Focus on MAX**: Mojo's focus is currently on MAX, a platform for accelerated compute, rather than focusing solely on networking.
   - This decision is backed by solid arguments, as MAX has a larger impact in the compute space than the network space.
- **MAX's Capabilities & Use Cases**: MAX is a library for controlling hardware beyond the CPU, including GPUs, DPUs, and potentially even custom NICs.
   - It can be used for tasks like high performance networking, web servers, and implementing TCP/IP protocol clients and servers.
- **Mojo's Package Management**: The Mojo team is considering how to best manage packages, with a preference for smaller, modular packages.
   - They're currently focused on delivering key features like GPU support before exploring options for splitting packages into smaller units.
- **MAX's Role in Matrix Multiplication**: MAX aims to provide a single implementation for matrix multiplication that can be compiled to the optimal sequence of instructions for different hardware platforms.
   - This involves using MLIR to represent the high-level operation and then selecting optimized kernels based on the available hardware.
- **Mojo's Branding & Identity**: Mojo is established as a programming language, but the entire platform needs a brand, which is MAX - the Modular Accelerated Xecution Platform.
   - MAX will encompass various components, including GPUs, graph API, and other features, and will continue to evolve as new capabilities are developed.

- **Mojo Community Meetings #6 Recording Available**: The recording for the latest Mojo Community Meeting is now available on YouTube, covering topics such as small buffer and string optimizations, DuckDB bindings in Mojo, and MAX.
   - The recording can be accessed at [https://youtu.be/6huytcgQgk8](https://youtu.be/6huytcgQgk8).
- **Radical String Approach in Mojo**: A member shared their implementation of a Mojo String with small string optimizations and Unicode support using field space stealing and a Unicode codepoint index.
   - The code, available at [https://gist.github.com/mzaks/78f7d38f63fb234dadb1dae11f2ee3ae](https://gist.github.com/mzaks/78f7d38f63fb234dadb1dae11f2ee3ae), is a proof of concept that demonstrates the manageable complexity of the approach, with the Unicode codepoint index being more challenging than the small string optimization.
- **Mojo String's Future: Decoupling from List**: The current Mojo String implementation is a wrapper around a List data structure, making small string optimization difficult.
   - A member suggests that the standard library String will need to decouple itself from List to implement the field space stealing technique.
