- **Guidance on Mistral API Parameters**: `@lerela` responded to the query, describing the context window `(32k)` and rate limits `(2M tokens/minute)` as outlined in the documentation. The timeout was mentioned to be comprehensive. The user was also urged to set `max_tokens` and leverage response headers to track token usage due to the lack of an API for this purpose.
- **Inquiry about System Prompt and Chat Template**: `@caseus_` asked for advice on implementing the system prompt in the chat template, providing a [link](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1/blob/main/tokenizer_config.json#L42) to a specific tokenizer configuration as a reference.
- **Question Regarding Fine-tuning for Function Calling**: `@krissayrose` queried if anyone had performed fine-tuning for function calling.

- **API Rate Limit Issues**: Multiple users including `@robhaisfield` and `@d012394` are experiencing rate limit errors even though their token usage according to their dashboards doesn't seem close to the 2 million tokens per minute limit. `@robhaisfield` speculated that the issue might be due to how token output for the rate limiter is calculated ([video showing the problem](https://www.loom.com/share/faa3697694e746ba9717e75fe11423c5)).
- **Investigation by Mistral Staff**: `@lerela` requested affected users to DM their Profile IDs for further investigation and later announced that they had pushed changes to increase the reliability of the API.
- **Litellm Support for la-platforme**: `@brokearsebillionaire` inquired about support for la-platforme in litellm, which `@ved_ikke` affirmed by sharing [litellm's documentation on Mistral AI API](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers/mistral). `@brokearsebillionaire` later confirmed success in getting it to work.

## [OpenAccess AI Collective (axolotl)](https://discord.com/channels/1104757954588196865) Discord Summary

- Active discussions on **fine-tuning models** occurred across channels, covering aspects such as model performance at shorter context lengths (raised by `@noobmaster29`) and procedures for personal chat data (raised by `@enima`). Further, `@yamashi` shared their plans to train **Mixtral Moe** on specific data.
- The **Huggingface/transformers PR** was a key discussion point, concerning its potential impact on code adjustment, the need to use Flash Attention 2 effectively, and the **support for LoftQ** in PEFT. Direct links to the [pull request](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/28142) and the [LoftQ arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08659) were shared. 
- A new multimodal model was introduced by `@nanobitz`, [linking](https://baaivision.github.io/emu2/) to the respective source. Also, a resource related to **Half-Quadratic Quantization (HQQ)** was discussed but lacked substantial user feedback.
- A range of technical questions about different methodologies and tools were raised, including the use of **LLama.cpp internals**, **tokenizing Turkish text**, the processing of LLM inferences and **sliding windows for training** with axolotl.
- Several suggestions for Axolotl feature improvements and future projects were provided. Notably, users discussed the incorporation of **prompt gisting** and the addition of **chat templates to the tokenizer** after fine-tuning.

- **Finetuning Model with Shorter Context Length**: User `@noobmaster29` raised a question about the effects of finetuning a model at a shorter context length than the base model. `@nanobitz` conjectured the model would still work at the full length but might not perform as well.
- **Largest Model Sequence Length**: `@noobmaster29` further asked about tuning `Mistral` at `4096` instead of its max length of `8192`, to which `@nanobitz` reassured it would be totally fine.
- **New Multimodal Model Resource**: `@nanobitz` shared a link to a [new multimodal model](https://baaivision.github.io/emu2/) developed by Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence, Tsinghua University, and Peking University.
- **Training Mixtral Moe on Specific Data**: `@yamashi` mentioned planning to train a `Mixtral Moe` on their data in January, hoping for an 85% on `medqa` with possibly 90% by embedding answers in the prompt.
- **Half-Quadratic Quantization (HQQ) Resource**: `@dangfutures` asked if anyone had used the [Official implementation of Half-Quadratic Quantization (HQQ)](https://github.com/mobiusml/hqq), however no feedback was provided.
- **Prompt Gisting within Axolotl**: User `@lightningralf` raised a point on incorporating prompt gisting within `Axolotl`, to which `@caseus_` replied that while potentially useful, it would likely be slow to train due to how attention masking operates for token gisting.
- **Adding Chat Template to Tokenizer After Finetuning**: `@touristc` asked if `axolotl` is able to add chat templates to the tokenizer after finetuning, a feature `@caseus_` agreed would be quite beneficial.

- **Impact of the huggingface/transformers PR**: User `@nanobitz` alerted users about a new [pull request](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/28142) on the huggingface/transformers GitHub. This PR fixes the FA2 integration, and `@nanobitz` pointed out possible need for adjustment in their code. `@caseus_` acknowledged the potential impact of this change and plans to address it. 

- **Use of Flash Attention 2**: In the context of the mentioned PR, `@nanobitz` provided recommendations on how to use Flash Attention 2, mainly suggesting not to pass `torch_dtype` to the `from_pretrained` class method when using Flash Attention 2 and ensuring the use of Automatic Mixed-Precision training. 

- **Adding support for LoftQ in PEFT**: User `@nruaif` brought up support for LoftQ, a quantization method that improves Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuning. `@nruaif` stated that LoftQ has been supported in PEFT since version 0.7, providing a link to the respective [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08659). 

- **Usage of LoftQ with LoRA**: `@caseus_` hinted at the straightforward use of LoftQ with LoRa, providing an example code snippet.

- **Ongoing Experiment**: `@theobjectivedad` asked `@faldore` about any significant observations after freezing *.gate.weight. `@faldore` stated it's too soon to share results but promised to provide them on the following day.

- **Fine-tuning Models**: User `@enima` is considering **fine-tuning a model with personal chat data**, similar to the approach used in the Minotaur/Mistral-Dolphin projects. They acknowledge the need to rework their dataset on a small sample scale.
- **Help with llama.cpp Internals**: `@_awill` is seeking help from anyone familiar with **llama.cpp** internals for a discussion.
- **Tokenizing Turkish Text**: User `@emperor` encountered an issue while **training a tokenizer for Turkish text** using HF Tokenizers. Despite using a Turkish dataset with no Chinese text, the resulting vocabulary had an overwhelming number of Chinese characters. The issue reduced significantly when all Chinese characters and emojis were aggressively filtered out from a different dataset. The user still questions why less than 1% non-Turkish characters influenced the tokenizer to this extent.
- **LLM Inference Processing**: `@JK$` queried about the processing approach of LLM inferences. According to `@nruaif`, both **parallel processing** (speeds up the process but requires more VRAM) and a **queue** approach can be used, though the latter will have greater latency.
- **Sliding Windows for Training**: `@marijnfs` inquired if **axolotl supports sliding windows for training**, to which `@le_mess` replied affirmatively for Mistral. On asking why this feature is not a standard for all LLMs, `@le_mess` mentioned that only Mistral was trained with it. The option is enabled by default and there might not be an option to disable it.
