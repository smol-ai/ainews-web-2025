## /r/LocalLlama Recap


## 1. Google Gemma 3 QAT Quantization and Ecosystem Launches

- **[Google QAT - optimized int4 Gemma 3 slash VRAM needs (54GB -&gt; 14.1GB) while maintaining quality - llama.cpp, lmstudio, MLX, ollama](https://i.redd.it/23ut7jd3klve1.jpeg)** ([Score: 506, Comments: 108](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1k25876/google_qat_optimized_int4_gemma_3_slash_vram/)): **The image is a bar chart visually demonstrating the impact of Google's QAT (Quantization Aware Training) on the memory requirements to load Gemma 3 models using int4 quantization versus bf16 weights. Notably, the 27B parameter model's VRAM requirement drops from 54GB (bf16) to just 14.1GB (int4), representing substantial savings while, as QAT ensures, maintaining bf16-level output quality. The post also notes direct availability of these formats via HuggingFace for use in MLX, Hugging Face transformers (safetensors), and GGUF formats (for llama.cpp, lmstudio, ollama), enabling broad platform compatibility.** A prominent comment stresses the significance of QAT checkpoints, which involve post-quantization fine-tuning to recover accuracy—meaning that, specifically with Gemma 3 QAT, int4 models match bf16 performance. Another comment highlights that such quantization improvements are expected, though QAT enhances the quality beyond typical post-training quantization.

- QAT (Quantization Aware Training) checkpoints for Gemma 3 involve further training the model after quantization, allowing the Q4 variant to achieve near-bfloat16 (bf16) accuracy, a significant boost over traditional post-training quantization methods. This improves inference efficiency without the typical loss in precision commonly seen with aggressive quantization.
  - Technical differences in Google's official QAT GGUF models are noted: they use fp16 precision for the `token_embd` weight and do not employ imatrix quantization, potentially preventing optimal file size reductions. Community efforts, such as those by /u/stduhpf, have surgically replaced these weights with Q6_K for better size/performance ratios (details: [Reddit link](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jsq1so/smaller_gemma3_qat_versions_12b_in_8gb_and_27b_in/)).
  - Performance benchmarking shows that, despite reduced size (e.g., 27B Q4 ~16GB), Gemma 3 QAT models have relatively slow token generation (tg) speed, performing on par with Mistral-Small-24B Q8_0 on Apple M1 Ultra hardware and slower than Qwen2.5 14B Q8_0 or Phi-4 Q8_0. There are also early reports of broken QAT checkpoints (such as the 1B-IT-qat version) and vocabulary mismatch issues in certain speculative decoding workflows.

- **[New QAT-optimized int4 Gemma 3 models by Google, slash VRAM needs (54GB -&gt; 14.1GB) while maintaining quality.](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemma-3-quantized-aware-trained-state-of-the-art-ai-to-consumer-gpus/?linkId=14034718)** ([Score: 240, Comments: 30](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1k250r6/new_qatoptimized_int4_gemma_3_models_by_google/)): **Google has released new Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) optimized `int4` Gemma 3 models, reducing VRAM requirements from `54GB` to `14.1GB` without significant loss in model quality [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1d7e58c/new_qatoptimized_int4_gemma_3_models_by_google/). QAT is a technique where the impact of quantization is simulated during training, enabling low-bit inference with minimal accuracy degradation, marking this as a notable step for efficient model deployment.** Comments highlight community anticipation for properly QAT-optimized models and note confusion about prior QAT releases from Google, suggesting this release is the first to meet practical VRAM efficiency needs at int4 precision.  [External Link Summary] Google’s Gemma 3 models now include Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) variants, enabling efficient, high-quality inference on consumer-grade GPUs by reducing numeric precision down to int4 (4-bit). QAT-integrated training allows Gemma 3 models—as large as 27B parameters—to run on GPUs like the RTX 3090 with as little as 14.1GB VRAM for the largest model, with minimal degradation in AI quality (perplexity drop reduced by 54% versus naive post-quantization). Pre-built integrations support major inference engines (Ollama, llama.cpp, MLX), and official models are available on Hugging Face and Kaggle; the broader Gemma ecosystem also supports alternative quantization strategies for specific hardware or performance/quality trade-offs.  [Read the original blog post](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemma-3-quantized-aware-trained-state-of-the-art-ai-to-consumer-gpus/)

- The discussion highlights a significant reduction in VRAM requirements for Google's new QAT-optimized int4 Gemma 3 models, shrinking from 54GB to 14.1GB, and underscores the importance of such optimizations for broader hardware accessibility without quality loss.
  - References to tools like Bartowski, Unsloth, and GGML suggest a technically engaged community tracking both upstream and third-party advancements in quantization-aware training (QAT) and model deployment efficiency.
  - There is curiosity about the feasibility of further compression (e.g., reducing model size to 11GB), pointing toward ongoing interest in pushing the limits of quantization techniques and hardware accommodation while maintaining inference quality.

- **[Gemma 3 QAT launch with MLX, llama.cpp, Ollama, LM Studio, and Hugging Face](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1k250fu/gemma_3_qat_launch_with_mlx_llamacpp_ollama_lm/)** ([Score: 144, Comments: 37](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1k250fu/gemma_3_qat_launch_with_mlx_llamacpp_ollama_lm/)): **Google has released unquantized QAT (Quantization-Aware Training) checkpoints for Gemma 3, allowing third parties to perform their own quantization; the approach preserves model quality comparable to bfloat16 at significantly reduced memory requirements. The models are natively supported across major platforms (MLX, llama.cpp, Ollama, LM Studio, Hugging Face), and both GGUF-format quantized weights and the new unquantized checkpoints are publicly available ([blog post](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemma-3-quantized-aware-trained-state-of-the-art-ai-to-consumer-gpus/), [Hugging Face collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/google/gemma-3-qat-67ee61ccacbf2be4195c265b)). Despite support across tooling, integration nuances remain: official guidance emphasizes quantizing with Q4_0, yet harmonizing this with other quantization techniques and frameworks (e.g. HuggingFace Transformers’ support for 4-bit quantization) is unclear.** Redditors report inconsistencies and breakages across formats—e.g., MLX 4-bit models responding with '<pad>' in LM Studio, differing model sizes between LM Studio and Hugging Face builds, and confusion over which model version is authoritative. Experts debate whether HF Transformers’ quantization implementations (bitsandbytes, GPTQ, AWQ, etc.) are compatible with Q4_0, recognizing a lack of documentation about optimal QAT-based workflow for HF-backed inference.

- There is technical confusion about quantization levels for Gemma 3 QAT models in MLX, specifically the presence of 3-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit versions. One user notes that the 8-bit MLX versions seem to merely upsample the 4-bit QAT weights, using 'twice as much memory for no benefit,' raising concerns about memory efficiency and the legitimacy of the quantization process. Also, reports indicate that the 4-bit MLX versions only return <pad> tokens in LM Studio 0.3.14 (build 5), suggesting a possible compatibility bug with that release.
  - A technical debate arose about inconsistent model size reporting between LM Studio and HuggingFace/Kaggle for the same QAT checkpoints (e.g., LM Studio reports 12B QAT as 7.74GB, HuggingFace as 8.07GB, but download yields 7.5GB). Further investigation shows a 4b QAT Q4_0 model being 2.20GB (LM Studio) versus 2.93GB (HuggingFace), indicating there are multiple, non-identical builds—raising the question of which source is most accurate and up-to-date.
  - There is significant uncertainty regarding optimal quantized inference with Gemma 3 QAT models using HuggingFace Transformers. The official guidance only provides direct support/examples for the non-QAT model, while the QAT quantization process recommends GGUF Q4_0 (a 4-bit round-to-nearest, legacy quantization). Since HF Transformers supports its own 4-bit quantization formats (e.g., bitsandbytes, AWQ, GPTQ), it's unclear whether these methods align with GGUF Q4_0's scaling/thresholds—affecting whether the QAT-tuned model's benefits are actually preserved when using HF-supported quantization pipelines.


## 2. Novel LLM Benchmarks: VideoGameBench & Real-time CSM 1B

- **[Playing DOOM II and 19 other DOS/GB games with LLMs as a new benchmark](https://v.redd.it/u1i2op2o8mve1)** ([Score: 490, Comments: 98](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1k28f3f/playing_doom_ii_and_19_other_dosgb_games_with/)): **Researchers have introduced VideoGameBench ([project page](https://vgbench.com)), a vision-language model benchmark requiring real-time completion of 20 classic DOS/GB games such as DOOM II, tested on models like GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.7, and Gemini 2.5 Pro/2.0 Flash ([GitHub link](https://github.com/alexzhang13/VideoGameBench)). Models displayed limited interactive reasoning and planning capabilities, with none surpassing even the first level of DOOM II, highlighting substantial current limitations in LLM-based agents for complex, real-time environments.** Comments humorously reference the classic 'Can it run doom?' meme and lightly debate the value of gaming as an intelligence benchmark, but no deep technical debate is present.  [External Link Summary] Researchers have introduced VideoGameBench (https://vgbench.com), a new benchmark designed to evaluate vision-language models (VLMs) on their ability to play 20 classic video games (DOS/GB platforms) in real time via visual input and text commands. Major LLM/VLM systems, including GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.7, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, were benchmarked on the task (e.g., DOOM II, default difficulty) using identical prompts, with none able to clear even the first level, revealing the current limitations of VLMs in dynamic, real-time visual-reasoning and decision-making tasks. Relevant code and evaluation details are available at https://github.com/alexzhang13/VideoGameBench.

- A user raises concerns about performance and latency when using a reasoning model like Gemini 2.5 Pro for gaming tasks, noting that reasoning models may not be optimized for low-latency or real-time interaction compared to non-reasoning architectures.
  - Another comment expresses technical skepticism, stating interest in sub-8B parameter models capable of real-time gameplay following text instructions on a single GPU with ~400GB/s memory bandwidth, suggesting improvements in architecture are needed to make this feasible with current resource constraints.

- **[CSM 1B is real-time now and has fine-tuning](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1k1v9rq/csm_1b_is_realtime_now_and_has_finetuning/)** ([Score: 151, Comments: 30](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1k1v9rq/csm_1b_is_realtime_now_and_has_finetuning/)): **CSM 1B, an open-source Text-to-Speech (TTS) model, now supports real-time streaming and LoRA-based fine-tuning, as detailed in this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/davidbrowne17/csm-streaming). The author implemented a real-time local chat demo and fine-tuning via LoRA, with alternative support for full fine-tuning. The repository demonstrates performance improvements that enable real-time inference, making it competitive with other open-source TTS models.** Commenters are inquiring about compatibility with Apple Silicon and are interested in technical details about the optimizations made for real-time performance. There's also a general positive reception towards ongoing iterative development.

- There is discussion around achieving near real-time inference using high-end GPUs like the 5090, with reported performance up to `0.5s` (2x real-time) for inference, though latency issues remain due to container spin-up. Deployment examples include running inference as a serverless instance and attempts to stream audio output over WebSocket from a Docker container.
  - Questions were raised about Apple Silicon compatibility, specifically whether performance—albeit slower—would allow the model to run effectively on Apple hardware. Another user described porting the codebase to MLX for Apple Silicon, reporting that CPU inference outperformed the current Metal backend, but with less-than-optimal results overall.
  - There is technical curiosity about the ability to fine-tune the model for languages beyond its original training set, as well as whether the reference voice needs to be in the same language as the generated audio, implying interest in multilingual support and the data constraints for fine-tuning.

- **[microsoft/MAI-DS-R1, DeepSeek R1 Post-Trained by Microsoft](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/MAI-DS-R1)** ([Score: 320, Comments: 73](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1k1qpr6/microsoftmaidsr1_deepseek_r1_posttrained_by/)): **Microsoft released MAI-DS-R1, a model based on DeepSeek R1 that appears to substantially improve code completion benchmarks, notably outperforming comparators on livecodebench. The announcement raises questions about scale, as previous large post-trainings (like Nous Hermes 405B) were considered state-of-the-art but this may represent a new largest post-train/fine-tune effort from a major provider.** Commenters note strong performance on specific coding benchmarks and discuss the geopolitical context, contrasting it with recent national security reports about large models. Technical discussion centers on the significance of Microsoft's investment in such large-scale post-training relative to community and industry efforts.  [External Link Summary] [MAI-DS-R1](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/MAI-DS-R1) is a DeepSeek-R1-based reasoning LLM post-trained by Microsoft for improved response on previously blocked/bias-prone topics and reduced risk, leveraging 110k safety/non-compliance samples (Tulu 3 SFT) and 350k internal multilingual bias-focused data. The model demonstrates superior safety and unblocking performance (matching or exceeding R1-1776 in benchmarks), with preserved reasoning, coding, and general knowledge capabilities, while remaining subject to inherent limitations (e.g., possible hallucinations, language bias, unchanged knowledge cutoff). Evaluation covers public benchmarks, a blocked-topic test set (11 languages), and harm mitigation (HarmBench), showing MAI-DS-R1 generates more relevant, less harmful outputs—though content moderation and human oversight remain recommended for high-stakes use.

  - Another comment mentions that Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro model also succeeded at this highly specific GeoGuessr task, suggesting that multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) multimodal models are achieving exceptional performance in real-world location recognition scenarios. This informs comparisons of model capabilities and highlights rapid progress among top-tier competitors.

- **[o3 is crazy at geoguessr](https://i.redd.it/uaoont4afmve1.png)** ([Score: 701, Comments: 91](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1k299vw/o3_is_crazy_at_geoguessr/)): **The image demonstrates an AI—referred to as 'o3'—accurately geolocating a highly specific snowy landscape in Uzbekistan’s Amirsoy Mountain Resort with minimal cues: no signage, no Google Street View coverage, and no visible metadata. The post underscores the technical feat, citing that o3 deduced not just the country but an exact spot based purely on environmental and geographic pattern recognition from the image.** Commenters compare o3's geolocation abilities to human experts and existing tools like Google Image Search, expressing amazement at LLM and AI pattern recognition capabilities. One user suggests wishing for human cognition to mimic LLMs in holding large patterns and visual data associations.

- A user raised the technical question of whether models like ChatGPT can access EXIF metadata embedded in uploaded images, positing that the accurate geolocation identification in GeoGuessr might be due to extraction of GPS or geotag data contained in image files rather than pure image pattern recognition.
  - Discussion compared GeoGuessr model performance to Google Image Search, hinting at the effectiveness of Google's similarity search algorithms for image-based geolocation and suggesting a potential benchmark comparison between AI models and search engine capabilities in precise location guessing.

- **[O3 is on another level as a business advisor.](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1k1q3dp/o3_is_on_another_level_as_a_business_advisor/)** ([Score: 277, Comments: 84](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1k1q3dp/o3_is_on_another_level_as_a_business_advisor/)): **The post details a qualitative comparison by a startup founder between OpenAI's O3 model and prior LLMs like GPT-4.5, emphasizing O3's more authoritative, directive advisory style in business strategy contexts compared to GPT-4.5's neutral or sycophantic tendency. The user cites a direct plan output by O3 that recommends shipping a minimum-viable feature to acquire real data, then iterating decisively based on measured engagement, contrasting this with earlier models' tendency for endless hypothesis generation. Technically, the comments note that Gemini provides 'argumentative' feedback, and that O3 exhibits an improved, less-placating, more expert persona, but also has limits such as a ~200-line code output ceiling and possible overconfidence when presenting incorrect answers.** Respondents debate the value of LLMs with assertive ('non-placating') personalities, noting Gemini's confrontational stance versus O3's authoritative mentoring, and raise issues about O3's coded output and sometimes excessive assumed expertise.

- Several users compare O3's performance against other LLMs, noting its higher level of assertiveness and expertise in business advisory and technical areas compared to previous models and even Gemini 2.5 Pro/Sonnet 3.7. O3 often delivers authoritative and nuanced feedback, but may need prompting to simplify responses for less technical users.
  - Key technical limitations are cited: O3 currently has a coding output cap of ~200 lines per response, which can hinder more complex coding tasks and workflow integration. This is seen as a notable regression or barrier for technical users accustomed to larger outputs from alternative models.
  - There is confusion about model versioning and power: some users mistakenly believe O3 might be superior to O4 for reasoning and non-sycophantic responses, questioning whether O3's performance characteristics (i.e., less likely to placate users, more argumentative/dogmatic) are a technical feature or just tuning. Users highlight real-world A/B use across multiple models.

- **[o3 can't strawberry](https://i.redd.it/0sujckb77lve1.jpeg)** ([Score: 155, Comments: 45](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1k23qu5/o3_cant_strawberry/)): **The image documents a failure case in which OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo (referred to as "o3") incorrectly answers a basic factual question—claiming there are only 2 'r's in the word "strawberry" instead of the correct 3. The attached ChatGPT share link and screenshot capture the direct model output, highlighting a concrete example of an LLM factual hallucination or counting error. Additionally, the screenshot lacks the usual 'Thinking' placeholder in the UI, suggesting a potential interface or backend bug in addition to the LLM's mistake.** Several commenters state they could not reproduce the error, with both o3 and newer o4-mini models returning the correct answer, suggesting the issue may be intermittent or linked to a specific deployment glitch. A notable observation is the absence of the 'Thinking' block in the image, prompting speculation about an interface or backend anomaly accompanying the model's failure.

- Multiple users report that the failure to output the correct spelling of 'strawberry' in the O3 model cannot be consistently reproduced; even lower-tier models like o4-mini return the correct answer. Visual evidence (such as [this screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/qxze6e1nblve1.png?width=1588&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a82d5ed059427e6b4c005d841e3457823ecffed)) shows that both correct answers and normal "Thinking" blocks are present during typical queries, suggesting either a rare edge-case bug or an issue with a particular session.
  - There is a mention of the absence of the "Thinking" block in the original user's output, which is not standard behavior; this detail leads some to believe an atypical bug or execution path in the model response process may be involved.

## 3. AI Industry Infrastructure and Pricing Updates

- **[arXiv moving from Cornell servers to Google Cloud](https://info.arxiv.org/hiring/index.html)** ([Score: 122, Comments: 14](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1k22p74/arxiv_moving_from_cornell_servers_to_google_cloud/)): **arXiv is migrating its infrastructure from Cornell-managed on-premise servers to Google Cloud Platform (GCP), coinciding with a major codebase rewrite. The move aims to modernize arXiv's stack while leveraging cloud-native services, but raises concerns about potential vendor lock-in and operational risk from simultaneous major changes. Commenters note that arXiv already uses external distribution (e.g., Cloudflare R2) and that benefits like backups or scaling are not unique to GCP.** Technical commenters overwhelmingly caution against coupling a code rewrite with a cloud migration, arguing this increases project failure risk. There is discussion about the tradeoff between using GCP's managed services and the portability advantages of containerization, with one comment skeptical of the necessity given arXiv's existing external distribution mechanisms.  [External Link Summary] The arXiv careers page (https://info.arxiv.org/hiring/index.html) details current openings and hiring information for roles contributing to the arXiv e-print repository, a prominent preprint server funded by multiple foundations and hosted at Cornell University. The page typically includes technical roles in software development (such as Software Engineer and DevOps Specialist) focused on the maintenance, improvement, and scaling of the platform’s infrastructure and services. Positions require expertise in software engineering, DevOps practices, and a commitment to supporting open scientific communication at scale.

- A user points out a major technical risk: arXiv is planning to combine a ground-up rewrite with a migration from on-premises to Google Cloud simultaneously. This is often considered a bad practice in systems engineering due to compounded risk, as complex migrations and rewrites introduce many failure points when not staged separately.
  - Concerns are raised about arXiv becoming overcoupled to Google Cloud Platform (GCP), which would make future portability and multi-cloud strategies more difficult. The commenter suggests containerization as a best practice before cloud migration, allowing for easier deployment on any cloud provider, and notes that arXiv already distributes bulk data over Cloudflare R2, implying redundant cloud services are already in use.
  - Discussion draws parallels with other major archive transitions, notably dejanews being acquired by Google and its subsequent transformation into a less open, more restricted system (Google Groups). This highlights risk for arXiv's openness and long-term accessibility as control centralizes under a major corporate cloud provider.

- **[OpenAI Introduces “Flex” Pricing: Now Half the Price](https://rebruit.com/openai-introduces-flex-pricing-now-half-the-price/)** ([Score: 139, Comments: 41](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1k24f7n/openai_introduces_flex_pricing_now_half_the_price/)): **OpenAI announced a new 'Flex' pricing tier offering API usage at 50% reduced cost, with the trade-off of potentially slower, queued, or throttled responses during high demand. This is distinct from the previous batched API, which promised results within 'up to 24h' (typically much faster) for a similar discount, raising questions among developers about whether 'Flex' will replace the batched API.** Technical discussion centers on use cases where response latency is non-critical, with some users asking about functional and performance differences between 'Flex' and the existing batched API, specifically concerning queue times and workflow impact.  [External Link Summary] [OpenAI's Flex processing](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/flex-processing) is a beta pricing tier providing 50% reduced per-token costs for the o3 and o4-mini models by deprioritizing requests, making it suitable for background, non-production, or latency-tolerant workloads. Flex uses a simple synchronous API parameter (service_tier:"flex"), preserves streaming/function support, but lacks a fixed SLA and is subject to greater response-time variability and queuing during peak periods—distinct from the Batch API which is optimized for massive jobs via offline file submission and has separate quotas. ID verification is also now required for lower usage tiers to access certain features, and the update comes amidst competitive pressure in the AI API market to lower costs for developers. [Original article](https://rebruit.com/openai-introduces-flex-pricing-now-half-the-price/)

- A user requests detailed clarification comparing the new Flex pricing to the previously available Batched API. They note that the Batched API promised results within "up to 24h" but consistently returned responses much faster (typically within 1-10 minutes, maximum of 1 hour), accompanied by a 50% discount—raising the technical question of whether, or how, Flex replaces the Batched API both in SLA and architectural implementation.
  - Another user inquires about the presence of any truly asynchronous workflow support within the Flex API: specifically, whether the API allows for a request-tickets pattern where a client can submit a request, receive a ticket, and fetch results later (rather than maintain a persistent open connection), which is an important architectural consideration for certain use cases, especially to avoid the drawbacks of keeping connections open.
  - There is a question about how Flex pricing and token-based billing interact with the existing $20/month OpenAI consumer subscription, reflecting a need for clarification among technical users about what Flex means for different user tiers and how it impacts overall cost structures for varying levels of usage.

> `Dayhush vs Nightwhisper, Gemini 2.5 Pro vs Grok 3 Mini, Polymarket & LM Arena, AlphaZero, AlphaGo, New models and model releases` 


- **Dayhush Rising as Nightwhisper Heir**: Members are comparing [Dayhush](https://link.to/dayhush-example) to **Nightwhisper**, with some finding **Dayhush** superior in coding and web design, potentially dethroning **3.7 Sonnet** for real-world coding tasks.
   - Users shared prompts like *"create pokemon game"* and other visually stunning requests to get the models to generate code.
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro and Grok 3 Mini battle it out**: **Grok 3 Mini** is emerging as a strong competitor, with some finding it on par with or slightly better than **Gemini 2.5 Pro**, particularly with tool use, although it may be too aggressive with tool calling.
   - Price is a factor as a user stated that **Grok 3 Mini** is *1/7th the output token price of 2.5 flash thinking*.
- **Polymarket and Arena Interplay**: Discussion arose around the potential for [market manipulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart's_law) on **Polymarket** influencing model evaluations in **LM Arena**, particularly with bets riding on **o3** or **o4-mini** surpassing **2.5 Pro**.
   - There was an admission that rigging the arena for **o3** would have a bigger profit than other models.
- **AlphaGo and the new models**: Members discussed vastly different architectures, that a Transformer LLM cannot be trained the way **Alpha*** is, and if it could be, it doesn't operate in a way that would allow it to use that training anyway, mentioning that it is *vastly different*.
   - User shared that, as most things in LLMs, **Thinking Mode** is just a primitive, degenerate form of bending policy search, giving the LLM a few dozen shots at getting to a better solution, but it's neither systematic nor exhaustive, nor does it have a world model or persistent state to simulate or probe internally.
- **Gemini Ultra on the Horizon**: There are rumors of a new **Google coder model** potentially named "Gemini Coder", confirmed by a Google employee, with expectations that **Gemini Ultra** will offer scaling improvements over **Pro** but may come with a higher cost.
   - Some users speculate on the ideal model size and the potential for models to reason in latent space, enhancing efficiency and mimicking human-like thinking, with one user wondering when Gemini Ultra would be released.

> `MLIR arith dialect in Mojo, Dict value pointer copies and moves, Variadic set element moves, Ratio type representation, Parallelization performance` 


- **MLIR's `arith` dialect missing in Mojo**: The `arith` dialect is not loaded by default in Mojo; only the `index` and `llvm` dialects are accessible, and there are currently no mechanisms to register other dialects.
   - A user received an error *'use of unregistered MLIR operation arith.constant'* when trying to use `arith.constant`.
- **`Dict.get_ptr` triggers surprising copies and moves**: A user discovered that retrieving a pointer to a `Dict` value in Mojo unexpectedly invokes a copy and a move constructor, as shown in [this code snippet](https://github.com/modular/max/blob/main/mojo/stdlib/src/collections/dict.mojo#L1042).
   - A [PR](https://github.com/modular/max/pull/4356) was made to address the copy issue, which was traced to a specific line of code within the `get_ptr` function.
- **Variadic packs require `UnsafePointer` for moves**: Moving values from a variadic pack in Mojo requires using `UnsafePointer` and disabling the destructor to avoid unwanted copies.
   - A member showed using `__disable_del args` in the `take_args` function to prevent destructors from being invoked on the original elements, raising concerns about potential memory leaks if not handled correctly.
- **Ratio type via `FloatLiteral` in Kelvin discussed**: A member suggested representing the ratio type in Kelvin using a `FloatLiteral`, given that a `FloatLiteral` is essentially a ratio of integer literals.
   - Others noted that while `FloatLiteral` materializes to a `Float64`, it can also construct SIMD floating-point types directly, but there's no guarantee multiplying by a float literal will result in an `Int/Uint`.
- **Matrix Parallelization benchmarked**: A member observed that parallelized matrix operations initially perform worse than for loops on small matrices due to overhead during warmup, but then achieve comparable performance in subsequent steps.
   - It's uncertain whether this behavior is expected, and they are requesting feedback as to whether there is something wrong with their benchmarking.
