title: 'Reasoning Price War 2: Mistral Magistral + o3''s 80% price cut + o3-pro'
date: '2025-06-10T05:44:39.731046Z'
description: >-
  **OpenAI** announced an **80% price cut** for its **o3** model, making it
  competitively priced with **GPT-4.1** and rivaling **Anthropic's Claude 4
  Sonnet** and **Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro**. Alongside, **o3-pro** was released
  as a more powerful and reliable variant, though early benchmarks showed mixed
  performance relative to cost. **Mistral AI** launched its **Magistral**
  reasoning models, including an open-source **24B parameter** version optimized
  for efficient deployment on consumer GPUs. The price reduction and new model
  releases signal intensified competition in reasoning-focused large language
  models, with notable improvements in token efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

Every 3-4 months we get a big leg down in the cost of the frontier LLM ([March 2024](https://x.com/swyx/status/1772799201023557697), [Aug 2024](https://news.smol.ai/issues/24-08-08-ainews-too-cheap-to-meter-ai-prices-cut-50-70percent-in-last-30-days), [Jan 2025)](https://news.smol.ai/issues/25-01-22-ainews-bespoke-stratos-sky-t1-the-vicunaalpaca-moment-for-reasoning), and today we got confirmation of the [80% price cut for o3](https://x.com/sama/status/1932434606558462459), making it nominally the same cost as GPT 4.1, the non-reasoning model. (you can be forgiven for suspecting the price cut is due to distillation, but this is categorically [denied](https://x.com/TheRealAdamG/status/1932534244774957121)). Of course, the real cost come in the reasoning token efficiency, and fortunately o3 is [notably](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/1932489580592435301) better than Gemini and Deepseek in that department:

Alongside of this o3 price cut, [o3 pro was released](https://www.latent.space/p/o3-pro), which if the o1/o1-pro relationship holds is more or less 10 o3's in a trenchcoat (and is priced that way).

This news is released conveniently on the same day as [Mistral's Magistral](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44236997) reasoning model - a 24B open source version and a Medium closed version - that would've otherwise taken today's headline. We're REALLY glad though that Mistral is continuing to release good open source models but unfortunately the o3 price cut is more likely to be the relevant story for the majority of AI engineers today.

Technical comment highlights include speculation that input token costs are a small fraction of overall LLM serving costs (with output tokens comprising '>90%'), so input price cuts may not drastically impact total API pricing; and mention of competitive pressure from open-weight models like DeepSeek and rival offerings from Google Gemini and Anthropic Claude.** Commenters debate the true impact of any price reduction, noting that unless output token prices fall, the effect on developers may be limited. There is also mention of growing preference toward open-weight models due to flexibility and cost advantages.
    - Discussion highlights the operational cost structure of reasoning models, with one user noting that output tokens account for ">90% of costs," making input cost reductions less impactful on overall pricing. This is particularly relevant for price comparisons and cloud inference optimization.
    - Usage statistics from OpenRouter are referenced, showing o3 has notably low adoption—outside the top 20—while models like 2.5 Pro and Sonnet rank in the top five despite being premium, which suggests significant market preference trends and may pressure pricing or product focus. See [OpenRouter rankings](https://openrouter.ai/rankings?view=month).
    - One commenter asserts that if recent price reductions for o3 are real, it remains a competitive state-of-the-art (SOTA) model. They also identify qualitative differences, such as o3's capability being more consistent or impressive compared to models like Gemini, which, despite being less 'lazy,' often misinterprets tasks.
- [**I bet o3 is now a quantized model**](https://i.redd.it/sanv7g7mn46f1.png) ([Score: 148, Comments: 55](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1l83em6/i_bet_o3_is_now_a_quantized_model/)): **The image presents a table benchmarking the performance of the OpenAI o3 model, with notable improvements in tokens per second (tps) after an 80% price reduction, suggesting backend changes such as quantization. The speculation is that such a drastic speed increase ('multiples of anything I've seen before') implies a switch to a quantized version, as quantization can significantly boost inference speed and reduce model size. However, a top comment notes OpenAI does not typically switch models on an API slug without a name change, so the improvements may also be due to other backend optimizations rather than actual quantization.** Commenters clarify terminology (quantization refers to reducing parameter precision, often from FP32 to int8/16 to increase speed and efficiency) and question the likelihood of a model swap without a new slug, with some suggesting possible 'lossless backend optimization' instead.
    - One user notes that in the OpenAI API, model upgrades or significant architectural changes always result in a new model slug (name), so if the model slug for o3 hasn't changed, it likely hasn't received major updates or quantization, and any backend improvements would be lossless and not affect inference results.
    - There's a technical prompt to benchmark the model, highlighting that any claims about quantization or changes (such as the transition from o3 to 4o, or comparisons to Blackwell) should be substantiated with actual benchmarking to determine performance or output differences.

   - If there isn't any cross-task transfer it's just a waste of compute training a generalist agent.
- **Mixed LM Head/Regression in Transformers**: A member asked about doing mixed lm head/regression in transformers, where the embedding layer of the numeric symbols is replaced with an MLP into **R^d**, and then doing a regression head instead of an LM head for out projection.
   - Another member provided [a relevant paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02989) using a custom tokenizer and a regression loss, but the actual generation is still in the token space, but thought that the actual generation is still in the token space.
- **SOTA SVG transformer uses discrete tokens**: The current **SOTA SVG transformer** uses discrete values for each numeric, using discrete tokens for *each coordinate* and constrains itself to a **200x200 grid** which gives them a vocabulary of **40k tokens** *only for coordinates*.
   - It was also mentioned that changing the coord embedding from 1 to 2 tokens reduces vocab from **V to sqrt(V)**, but severely degrades performance.
- **Deduping Internet Scraped Data**: A member noted that fully deduping internet scraped data is basically impossible due to overlaps in the density of scraped data, which is a very hard thing to both detect & mitigate.
   - Another member linked [a related paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04613).

- **DGX Spark Faces Bandwidth Blues**: Members debated whether the **DGX Spark**'s memory bandwidth would limit its LLM performance, similar to the **Strix Halo**, despite having potentially better compute power.
   - One member argued that *it's not all about memory bandwidth*, using the analogy of a machine with high RAM but a slow CPU, while others emphasized that memory bandwidth is often the bottleneck for dense LLMs.
- **Homelab Distributed Computing Dilemma**: Someone inquired about using distributed computing for LLMs in a homelab setup, similar to **Distributed Llama**, but it was deemed *not generally a good idea*.
   - However, **EXA** or **llama-mpi** were mentioned as potential alternatives, but the general sentiment leaned towards focusing on individual machine performance rather than distributed setups.
- **ROCm Shines on Windows**: A user reported successfully running **ROCm/HIP PyTorch** preview on Windows, referring to it as *an abomination* that works surprisingly well.
   - The user noted that while some modules may not fully support this setup and optimizations are not remembered across relaunches, the overall experience was positive compared to previous attempts with **ZLUDA**.
- **Speculative Decoding Hardware Hacking**: Members discussed speculative decoding and the possibility of offloading the draft model to a different GPU or CPU, such as leveraging an **RX 9070 XT** with a **GTX 1060**.
   - It was clarified that offloading to the CPU is a different method than changing runtimes, and while offloading to another GPU on the same runtime should be technically possible, it's complicated by each GPU typically having its own runtime.
- **Digits vs Dual GPUs: Bandwidth Bottleneck**: The question of how **Nvidia's Project Digits** would compare to a **5090 + 3090** setup for AI tasks within 56GB VRAM was posed, with the consensus leaning towards **Digits** being slower.

- **Gemini 2.5 Pro Lags in Library Updates**: Members noted that **Gemini 2.5 Pro** struggles with understanding that new versions of libraries exist and doesn't follow instructions well, even when given explicit rules.
   - In contrast, **Claude Opus and Sonnet** are much better at understanding these nuances; a member quantified the effectiveness of cursor rules as 80%+ with Claude Sonnet, 95%+ with Opus, and only 50 with 2.5 Pro.
- **DeepSeek R1 Aider Benchmarks Slow but Promising**: Aider benchmarks show **DeepSeek R1 (0528)** could be fairly good if the long case times (reportedly due to low resources/busy API) are addressed.
   - One user suggested that a **7x speedup** might be possible with more resources; another user noted it has a much lower tendency to sperg-loop COT (Chain of Thought) than previous iterations.
- **Uninstalling Aider Chat**: A user asked for the correct way to uninstall Aider from a Linux machine after using `pip install aider-install && aider-install`.
   - The suggested solution was to use `pip uninstall aider-chat`, though this leaves behind the binary, `aider`, which can be manually deleted along with indexes and cache files.
- **OpenAI O3 Price Drops but KYC still needed**: **OpenAI** announced **O3** pricing at **$2 input, $8 output**, an 80% price drop, however, using it via OpenRouter still requires bringing your own key and KYC (Know Your Customer) verification.
   - Some users expressed disappointment over the KYC requirement, while one pondered whether O3 has become a *mini model* and suggested re-benching it.
- **Kingfall model edges out O3 Pro**: A user shared an image comparing **Kingfall (auto thinking)** versus **0605 (32k)**, showing that it performed better.
   - This shows that it outperformed a recent model in at least one coding benchmark.

> `HuggingFaceModelTokenizer Usage, Muon Performance in torchtune, Tokenizer truncation bugs, Kimi Moonlight paper, Qwen2` 


- **`HuggingFaceModelTokenizer` Intended Usage Debated**: Members discussed the intended usage of `HuggingFaceModelTokenizer`, with concerns raised about the interface differences and how to handle `max_seq_len` for packing, in particular whether to change recipes or the tokenizer itself.
   - One member suggested a solution where the recipes should be changed to take a `max_seq_len` which is then passed through, which is close to the HF pattern and aligned with [this proposal](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtune/pull/2803#discussion_r2138285972).
- **HF Tokenizer Integration Faces Hurdles**: After testing the HF Tokenizer, it was found that loss curves and total tokens don't align with the classic tokenizer, suggesting differing behavior despite minor code changes; the integration will be ready after issues [#2794](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtune/pull/2794) and [#2574](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtune/pull/2574) are addressed.
   - Also the member reported that *pre-packing takes 2-3 times longer*.
- **Tokenizer truncation bugs found**: Bugs were found in truncation while implementing the tokenizer, with related points highlighted in issue [#2792](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtune/pull/2792) with concerns that this can affect performance.
   - Members suggest sticking with the original tokenizers for training for now, awaiting consolidation to the HF ones later.
- **Muon Integration Performance Scrutinized**: The performance benefits of Muon, when integrated into torchtune, are being scrutinized, with one member wanting to see the performance benefits when it is **integrated in torchtune** to justify adding another abstraction, and another member wondering if issue [#2809](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtune/pull/2809) is critical.
   - A member points out that *there's some evidence that muon is more useful for finetuning models that were also pretrained with muon*, referencing the [Kimi Moonlight paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16982).
- **Qwen2 Issue Check**: A member has to check **Qwen2** to see if the truncation issue exists there also.
   - It was acknowledged that if the original testing didn’t find the difference, it probably doesn't make a big difference but we should fix it either way.

- **Transfer Learning techniques asked about**: A member inquired about the possibility of transferring post-training learning from one model to another without repeating the learning process, like finetuning or RL.
   - No specific answers were provided in the channel.
- **DSPy Documentation Vanishes**: A user noted that [a documentation file](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy/pull/8094/files#diff-c7d76e3e57f0ce279bc4000266c3ec228863080e4cf891fd61e0ff6fd7575da6) was removed in a recent PR and expressed difficulty finding the same level of parameter documentation elsewhere.
   - Another user shared a link to [AI-generated docs](https://deepwiki.com/stanfordnlp/dspy/4.1-teleprompters-and-optimization#miprov2-multi-prompt-instruction-and-retrieval-optimization) that might be helpful.
- **DSPy's Contextual Prompt Optimizer**: A user asked if DSPy has anything to optimize what context to include in a prompt when a dozen variables are available.
   - They wanted to see which combination leads to good metrics balanced against the token usage of the prompt, but there was no further discussion on the topic.
- **Dataset building and export tools for DSPy**: A member asked about tools to easily build up and export datasets for use with DSPy.
   - They specifically mentioned needing something that allows generating a few dozen synthetic examples and then hand labeling them, but there was no further discussion on the topic.

- **Tests Failing, Bounty Locked Blocked**: Members reported that the **tests are failing**, which means that a bounty cannot be locked (ready to merge).
   - It was clarified that *bounty locked means basically ready to merge, or serious tested progress toward a goal*, but failing CI will prevent it.
- **Call for AI-Free PRs**: A member requested tasteful PRs, like the one addressing add/mul at [tinygrad/tinygrad#10741](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad/pull/10741), explicitly stating *no AI slop*.
   - It was noted that *add/mul were the easiest ones*.
- **NCHWCPUGraph and LLVMGraph Demand Refactor**: It was suggested that **NCHWCPUGraph / LLVMGraph** really need to be changed to behave like the other graphs.
   - These graphs *shouldn't be rerendering stuff*, and this is related to both **multicore CPU** and the **multi compiler/renderer refactor** where CPU and LLVM should use the same graph since they have the same program.
