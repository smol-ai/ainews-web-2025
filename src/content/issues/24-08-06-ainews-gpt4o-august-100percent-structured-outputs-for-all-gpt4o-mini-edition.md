- **Exploring LLMs in Software Engineering**: Researchers are examining the applications of **large language models (LLMs)** in areas like software engineering, especially in **code generation** and **vulnerability detection**. A study highlights the lack of a clear distinction between **LLMs and LLM-based agents**, stressing the need for unified standards and benchmarking.
  
  - Current efforts are still in early stages, making it unclear how to classify an LLM as an **LLM-based agent** in its respective domain.
- **Scaling Inference Compute Reveals Insights**: A recent study indicates that by increasing the number of inference samples, coverage—the fraction of problems solved—improves significantly, scaling across multiple tasks and models. For instance, using **DeepSeek-V2-Coder-Instruct**, success rates surged from **15.9%** with one sample to **56%** with 250 samples.
  
  - This approach provides a substantial performance boost in domains like coding and formal proofs, where all answers can be automatically verified, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art of **43%**.
