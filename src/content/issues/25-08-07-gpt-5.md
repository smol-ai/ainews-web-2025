While [the livestream](https://www.youtube.com/live/0Uu_VJeVVfo) was somewhat disappointing (except for [the highly entertaining chart crimes](https://x.com/DZhang50/status/1953510507631071658)), and the benchmarks were incremental improvements over the SOTA offerings from OpenAI, the pricing wow'ed us, as OpenAI took back the Pareto Frontier of Intelligence from GDM:

![](https://resend-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/S7YBUoJyxOQXcBC)

With OpenAI now having at least [a 4 Sonnet tier model](https://x.com/itsandrewgao/status/1953525984231067949/photo/1), passing [developer vibe checks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gXmWYQtv5o), it is solidly "back" in the coding model game, although it remains to be seen what the long term impact will be.

We recommend looking through the [hands-on early beta report](https://www.latent.space/p/gpt-5-review) and thinking through what was revealed from [the model card description of GPT-5's architecture](https://www.latent.space/p/gpt5-router).

Here is GPT-5's launch, according to GPT-5:

**OpenAI’s GPT‑5 Launch: unified router, aggressive pricing, broad rollout**

- **What shipped**: GPT‑5 is a “unified system” with a fast “main” model and a deeper “thinking” model behind a real‑time router that decides when to reason, call tools, or stay terse. In ChatGPT, there’s no model picker by default; Plus users can select GPT‑5 vs GPT‑5 Thinking; Pro gets more variants. API exposes gpt‑5, gpt‑5‑mini, gpt‑5‑nano and a “reasoning effort” control (minimal/low/medium/high). Context: up to 400K (128K max output). Knowledge cutoff reported as 2024‑10‑01 for main; minis reported as 2024‑05‑31. Rollout is staged to Free/Plus/Pro/Team (Enterprise/Edu next week). Announcements: [@OpenAI](https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1953526577297600557), [@sama](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1953502614676811865), [system card summary](https://twitter.com/iScienceLuvr/status/1953503173932724614).
- **Prices and cache**: Tweets cite gpt‑5 at $1.25/M input, $10/M output with cache discounts (“flex” references as low as $0.625/$5) and gpt‑5‑mini at $0.25/$2; gpt‑5‑nano at $0.05/$0.4. Multiple OpenAI leads emphasized the cost downshift and cache economics ([@scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/1953517149768593903), [@sama](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1953527247257899389), [@jeffintime](https://twitter.com/jeffintime/status/1953534466854453751)).
- **Product integrations (day‑0)**:
    - Chat/coding: Codex CLI makes GPT‑5 the default with usage included via ChatGPT plan; new terminal UI and rate‑limits by plan ([@OpenAIDevs](https://twitter.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1953559797883891735), [@embirico](https://twitter.com/embirico/status/1953590991870697896)). Cursor set GPT‑5 as the default coding model, temporarily free ([@cursor_ai](https://twitter.com/cursor_ai/status/1953519580627742750)). JetBrains AI Assistant and Junie agent support GPT‑5 ([@jetbrains](https://twitter.com/jetbrains/status/1953501570017919424)). Microsoft Copilot “Smart Mode” routes to GPT‑5 ([@mustafasuleyman](https://twitter.com/mustafasuleyman/status/1953505146828366125)). Notion AI now offers GPT‑5 ([@NotionHQ](https://twitter.com/NotionHQ/status/1953506907924443645)). Perplexity added GPT‑5 for Pro/Max ([@perplexity_ai](https://twitter.com/perplexity_ai/status/1953537170964459632)).
    - Agent scaffolds: Cline reports GPT‑5 is disciplined, parallelizes tool calls, and “plans verbose, executes terse” ([@cline](https://twitter.com/cline/status/1953525433808695319)); Factory made GPT‑5 its default for “Droids” ([@FactoryAI](https://twitter.com/FactoryAI/status/1953516542924353759)). OpenAI published a GPT‑5 prompting/cookbook bundle ([@OpenAIDevs](https://twitter.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1953528513480347840)).

**Benchmarks, evals, and the “chart crimes”**

- **Arenas and coding**: GPT‑5 tops LMSYS Text/WebDev/Vision Arenas (tested as “summit”), with a notably large WebDev margin ([@lmarena_ai](https://twitter.com/lmarena_ai/status/1953504958378356941)). OpenAI claims 74.9% on SWE‑bench Verified; several researchers immediately flagged a mislabeled axis and that OpenAI ran on a 477‑task subset; corrected charts put GPT‑5 roughly on par with Claude 4.1 Sonnet/Opus (74–75%) on the verified set ([@nrehiew_](https://twitter.com/nrehiew_/status/1953516694238114187), [@OfirPress](https://twitter.com/OfirPress/status/1953502998627221519), [@Sauers_](https://twitter.com/Sauers_/status/1953504854044704973)).
- **Long‑context and hallucinations**: GPT‑5 leads Artificial Analysis’ long‑context reasoning (AA‑LCR) occupying #1 and #2; big headline improvement over o3‑high on long‑context tasks ([@ArtificialAnlys](https://twitter.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/1953507713222422866)). Multiple claims of much lower hallucination and introduction of “safe completions” (refusal that maximizes utility within safety constraints) ([@scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/1953507569609134506), [@sama](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1953509759937917035)). METR’s autonomy eval finds GPT‑5 unlikely to pose catastrophic risk under current threat models, while cautioning about increased eval‑awareness/manipulation risk as capabilities rise ([@METR_Evals](https://twitter.com/METR_Evals/status/1953525150374150654)).
- **Reasoning/agents**: GPT‑5 shows strong instruction following and tool use (e.g., TauBench gains, IFBench instruction‑following), but mixed changes on non‑SWE coding evals and OpenAI PR‑reproduction ([@omarsar0](https://twitter.com/omarsar0/status/1953516984672420041), [@eli_lifland](https://twitter.com/eli_lifland/status/1953507434238288230), [@scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/1953505637242974695)).
- **ARC‑AGI and safety‑deception**: GPT‑5 hits 65.7% on ARC‑AGI‑1 but 9.9% on ARC‑AGI‑2; Grok‑4 leads ARC‑AGI‑2 at 15.9% ([@fchollet](https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1953511631054680085), [@scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/1953509485453902173)). GPT‑5 shows lower deceptive behavior than o3 in OpenAI’s internal measures (methodology matters; third‑party replication pending) ([@scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/1953504438691221856)).
- **Note on comms**: OpenAI’s event drew widespread criticism for multiple “chart crimes” (axis/scale errors) in slides—blog version was fixed later ([@jeremyphoward](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward/status/1953509671446196715), [@iScienceLuvr](https://twitter.com/iScienceLuvr/status/1953503815292092904)).

**Agentic coding reality check: strong tooling, fewer vibes**

- **Hands‑on reports**: Early users highlight GPT‑5’s “autistic” instruction following, fewer yaps, parallel tool calls, and long‑horizon persistence—e.g., multi‑file edits and reliable diffs (Codex CLI, Cline, Cursor). Several posts show one‑shot interactive apps/dashboards/games with minimal prompting ([@skirano](https://twitter.com/skirano/status/1953516768317628818), [@benhylak](https://twitter.com/benhylak/status/1953504800450154903), [@pashmerepat](https://twitter.com/pashmerepat/status/1953525616180949054)). Cursor calls GPT‑5 “the smartest coding model we've tried” and made it default, free initially ([@cursor_ai](https://twitter.com/cursor_ai/status/1953519580627742750)).
- **Routers are the product**: The deprecation of the in‑app model picker signals a bet on real‑time routing (thinking/tool use) as UX default; this shifts dev control from “which model?” to “what constraints/policy/verbosity/effort?” ([@sama](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1953526708742537220), [@dariusemrani](https://twitter.com/dariusemrani/status/1953591404003045562)).
- **Independent evals**: Deep‑research runs find GPT‑5 roughly comparable to Claude 4 Sonnet on long‑horizon research tasks (small sample), suggesting gains may be use‑case/stack dependent rather than across‑the‑board ([@hwchase17](https://twitter.com/hwchase17/status/1953555791493181648)).

**OpenAI's GPT-5 Launch and Reception**

- **The Announcement**: **OpenAI** officially announced the [launch of GPT-5](https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1953504357821165774), with CEO [@sama](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1953296157586931745) teasing a livestream that would be "longer than usual" with "a lot to show." The new model is described as a unified system that automatically switches between quick answers and deeper reasoning, [rolling out to all users, including the free tier](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1953502614676811865). OpenAI's Head of Product [@kevinweil](https://twitter.com/kevinweil/status/1953502681181618277) stated, "**It's the best thing we've ever built**." The release deprecates previous models, with the goal of simplifying the user experience by [removing the model switcher](https://twitter.com/nickaturley/status/1953568295774568582). An AMA with the team is scheduled [for the following day](https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1953548075760595186).
- **Technical Details and Pricing**: **GPT-5** is a family of models, not a single monolithic entity. It includes `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, and `gpt-5-nano`, and also separate "thinking" models, leading [@teortaxesTex](https://twitter.com/teortaxesTex/status/1953512363031757048) to call it a "**unified system**" that is "**literally just SEPARATE CoT + non-CoT models + a router**." API pricing was a major point of discussion, with [@scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/1953509084008710547) noting its competitiveness: the main model is priced at **$1.25/$10 per million tokens**, with `mini` at **$0.25/$2** and `nano` at **$0.05/$0.4**, all with a **400k context window** and a knowledge cutoff of **October 1st, 2024**. This makes it [cheaper than Sonnet and better than Opus](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/1953512175651139935). [@jerryjliu0](https://twitter.com/jerryjliu0/status/1953582723672814054) observed that for document understanding, GPT-5 seems to use **4-5x more tokens** than GPT-4.1, potentially increasing its effective cost for vision tasks.
- **Performance and Benchmarks**: Initial benchmarks show significant improvements in some areas but stagnation in others. [@scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/1953507426952507405) highlighted **"ridiculous improvements on long-context tasks"** and near-elimination of hallucinations. **GPT-5** also became the new [SOTA on the LMArena leaderboard](https://twitter.com/lmarena_ai/status/1953517672941158577). However, [@fchollet](https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1953509615624499571) reported that on **ARC-AGI**, GPT-5 scored **65.7% on AGI-1** and a modest **9.9% on AGI-2**. Further analysis from [@scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/1953503883331846629) showed only a **3% improvement** over `o3` in reproducing scientific papers and no significant improvement on benchmarks like **OpenAI Pull Requests** and **SWE-Lancer IC**.
- **The "Chart Crime" Controversy**: A significant part of the community discussion centered on misleading charts in the launch presentation. A chart on **SWE-Bench** performance was widely criticized for having a non-monotonic Y-axis, where **52.8%** was plotted higher than **69.1%**. This was first pointed out by [@Teknium1](https://twitter.com/Teknium1/status/1953502973897978078) and amplified by many, including [@jeremyphoward](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward/status/1953509671446196715). [@iScienceLuvr](https://twitter.com/iScienceLuvr/status/1953503815292092904) quipped, "If GPT-5 made this chart I'm bearish," while [@kipperrii](https://twitter.com/kipperrii/status/1953503956283584735) joked, "**fuck the y-axis! fuck the x-axis! just scribble on an exponential and go home!**" [@nrehiew_](https://twitter.com/nrehiew_/status/1953516694238114187) later provided a corrected version of the chart.

**Competing Models and The Broader Ecosystem**

- **xAI's Grok**: **Grok-4** emerged as a strong competitor, with [@fchollet](https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1953511631054680085) stating it remains **state-of-the-art on ARC-AGI-2**, scoring **15.9%** to GPT-5's 9.9%. [@Yuhu_ai_](https://twitter.com/Yuhu_ai_/status/1953551132921671712) claimed **xAI** is "ahead in many" aspects and that Grok was the "world's first unified model." In a dramatic turn, [@cb_doge](https://twitter.com/hyhieu226/status/1953220787084902888) reported that **Grok-4** defeated **Google's Gemini** in the Kaggle AI Chess semi-final, though it was ultimately [defeated by OpenAI's o3 in the final](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/1953522772308545574). In parallel, [@elonmusk](https://twitter.com/Yuhu_ai_/status/1953367318521655594) announced that **Grok Imagine** video generation would be free for all US users.
- **Perplexity and Multi-Model Support**: **Perplexity** announced [day-one support for GPT-5](https://twitter.com/perplexity_ai/status/1953537170964459632) for its subscribers. CEO [@AravSrinivas](https://twitter.com/AravSrinivas/status/1953550560176861336) highlighted their extensive model offerings, including **GPT-5**, **Claude 4.1 Opus**, **Grok 4**, and **Gemini 2.5 Pro**, positioning Perplexity as a key multi-provider platform.
- **Open vs. Closed Source Landscape**: [@Tim_Dettmers](https://twitter.com/Tim_Dettmers/status/1953521836299350494) offered a key insight, stating, "**It seems the closed-source vs open-weights landscape has been leveled. GPT-5 is just 10% better at coding than an open-weight model you can run on a consumer desktop**."

# AI Reddit Recap

## /r/LocalLlama + /r/localLLM Recap

### 1. GPT-OSS and OpenAI Model Hype and Brand Perception

- [**GPT-OSS is Another Example Why Companies Must Build a Strong Brand Name**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mjxx6j/gptoss_is_another_example_why_companies_must/) ([Score: 538, Comments: 329](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mjxx6j/gptoss_is_another_example_why_companies_must/)): **The post criticizes the disproportionate attention given to GPT-OSS 120B compared to technically stronger alternatives like Qwen-235B and DeepSeek R1, citing lack of multimodality, smaller size, and reliance on innovations from other open-source projects. The author highlights that Alibaba has released competitive models (e.g., Wan2.2 and Qwen-Image for video/image, high-performing 30B and 4B models) with little media coverage, attributing GPT-OSS's hype to OpenAI's branding rather than clear technical superiority. Notably, DeepSeek R1's cost-per-training is presented as evidence of superior efficiency (DeepSeek: $5.58M vs rumored OpenAI: much higher), and censorship complaints are discussed as inconsistently applied across regions/models.** Top comments emphasize the regional bias in influencer coverage (favoring US/English-language companies), shortcomings in technical depth of popular AI media channels, and technical distinctions—one commenter notes that OSS 120B is much sparser and faster than Qwen-235B, which justifies different use cases beyond raw benchmark scores. Non-compliance (re: alignment/safety behaviors) in OSS 120B is mentioned as a possible business feature, not a bug.
    - A technical distinction is made between OSS 120b and Qwen3 235b: OSS 120b has half as many parameters, only a quarter as many active parameters, and is extremely sparse, leading to significantly higher inference speeds compared to Qwen3 235b. However, OSS 120b's smaller size and sparsity also mean it's overly non-compliant for certain tasks, which some businesses might actually prefer due to regulatory or operational requirements.
    - Benchmarks are indirectly discussed: OSS 120b is said to be much faster than Qwen3 235b because of its sparsity and fewer active parameters, though it doesn't match larger models in overall capability. The comment also points out user preference for models like Qwen3 30b A3B, stating that smaller models like OSS 20b aren't as sparse and thus might not have the same speed advantage for their parameter size.
- [**If the gpt-oss models were made by any other company than OpenAI would anyone care about them?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mjsjkn/if_the_gptoss_models_were_made_by_any_other/) ([Score: 226, Comments: 119](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mjsjkn/if_the_gptoss_models_were_made_by_any_other/)): **The post questions whether the recent gpt-oss models would receive significant attention if released by a company other than OpenAI, given their reportedly inferior coding abilities relative to models like Qwen 32B, higher hallucination rates, and perceived overfitting to benchmarks. A technical comment highlights that the gpt-oss 120B model achieves an inference speed of 25 tokens/sec on a single RTX 3090 and i9-14900K, notably outperforming other local models at similar quantization levels (e.g., 70B q4), making it attractive for local deployment despite concerns about practical usability and excessive 'safety' constraints.** Commenters agree OpenAI's brand drives disproportionate hype, noting most of the public is unaware of other AI companies or models, but also credit OpenAI with advancing the open model scene's visibility. There is debate on whether the model's speed and local inference capability justifies some excitement independent of its brand.
    - The gpt-oss 120B model demonstrates a significant technical advantage—according to a user benchmark, it can run at 25 tokens/sec on a single 3090 + 14900K system. This is notably faster and more performant than other locally run 70B models using quantization (e.g., q4 or worse), which are described as "very very bad." Such speed and scale on consumer-grade hardware make it stand out among local LLMs.
    - There is ongoing debate regarding model utility: while gpt-oss 120B performs well speed-wise and in generating quality outputs (noted for "clear thinking patterns" and "quick and quality summaries"), concerns remain about the level of censorship ('safety') embedded in the model. Some users suggest a fine-tune is necessary to adapt the model for broader practical applications, as heavy safety alignment may reduce its usefulness for some tasks.
    - Historically, local LLMs were considered either not good enough or too slow, leading users to rely on API-based solutions (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude). gpt-oss 120B is seen as a turning point—potentially "on the edge" of making local deployment practically viable for demanding use-cases, pending further evaluation of its capabilities beyond speed and safety constraints.

> `Softmax1 vs Attention, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Long Context Problems, Mamba vs Transformer, RNN Parallel Training` 


- **Softmax1 Is Just Zero KV Attention**: A member discussed how *softmax1* is equivalent to prepending a token with an all-zero Key and Value features in attention, referencing [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.17453) on **learned values** for such tokens.
   - They added that this is great and makes a lot of sense.
- **Gemini 2.5 Excels in Long Video Context**: Members noted **Gemini 2.5 Pro** can attend to **1 hour** of video, with the Gemini team considered best at long context tasks.
   - However, some believe it's more about increased compute (`go brr`) and detail via **more tokens per frame** and **higher FPS** than any groundbreaking new technique.
- **Context Rot: Long Context Is Not Real**: One member argued *long context is not actually real* and there's a difference between surface-level video comprehension and reproducing detailed, accurate representations with **3D positioning**.
   - Another member asserted that **long sequence modeling** remains an active research area because even LLMs struggle with long-range dependencies.
- **Mamba's Parallel Training Makes It Shine**: Members discussed **Mamba**, clarifying it was never claimed to be *better* than **Transformer**, only *faster* at long sequence lengths and training like an RNN.
   - The consensus is that making RNNs as trainable as Transformers involves dropping nonlinearities in the recurrence relation to achieve easier parallel training, though nonlinearities remain essential for universal approximability.
- **SVD Compression for Deep Networks**: One member explored using **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** within neural networks to avoid matrix multiplications, embedding inputs, applying SVD, and performing scalar operations on singular values.
   - Another member pointed out that under L2 reconstruction loss, the SVD gives you the optimal linear autoencoder; while experimentation on MNIST yielded decent results, batch size dependency and achieving meaningful diagonal representation pose challenges.

> `Volokto, JS Runtime, Arbitrary Precision, Tracing JIT` 


- **Volokto JS runtime takes Flight**: A member created a JavaScript runtime called **Volokto** to test how complex VMs work, putting the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/BudNoise/Birdol).
   - The bytecode resembles **CPython**, and others suggested making a forum post about it to gain more visibility.
- **Conquering Compiler Conundrums for Volokto**: The author is rewriting the compiler to be more modular, separating it into **JS_Tokenizer**, **JS_IR**, **JS_Parser**, and **JS_Codegen** stages.
   - The compiler now generates VM bytecode, and the author might implement a tracing JIT that transpiles VM actions back to **Mojo**.
- **Volokto Tackles Tracing JIT Transpilation**: The goal is to make a tracing JIT to transpile what the VM does to Mojo, then using `mojo compile_result.mojo`.
   - The author named the runtime **Volokto**, the compiler **Bok**, and the VM **FlyingDuck**.
- **Arbitrary Precision Arithmetic adventures**: Working on the JS VM means dealing with arbitrary precision in Mojo code, which led to finding pain points and filing [an issue](https://github.com/modular/modular/issues/2776) for tracking numeric traits.
   - The author created a bigint class with school-grade addition for Fibonacci sequences and is using Mojo's reasonable features for VM development.
- **Birdol repo without stars**: The author expressed surprise at the lack of stars on the [Birdol GitHub repo](https://github.com/BudNoise/Birdol) despite creating a functional JS runtime with nested control flow and user-made functions.
   - Others suggested that people haven't had a good chance to examine it yet.

> `Multiple AI Agents in Mojo, Mojo and Meta Cognition, Mojo support for gpt-oss, CPython destroy` 


- **Orchestrating Multiple AI Agents in Mojo Requires Creative CLI Wrangling**: To run multiple AI agents in Mojo, one would need to run multiple instances of the Modular CLI and stick a reverse proxy in front.
   - For complex agent setups, such as creating many sub-agents, a custom application using **MAX** as a library might be necessary, hinting at deeper integration needs beyond the current CLI capabilities.
- **Mojo Could Enable Novel Meta Cognition Framework**: A community member expressed interest in utilizing Mojo code for their meta cognition framework, aiming to create a business planner, website, and chatbot builder.
   - Their framework uses natural language wrapped over Mojo code to potentially replace **HTML/JS/CSS**, making Mojo accessible to a broader audience.

> `MXFP4 format, OpenAI open-weight model, H100 support for FP4, Simulated MXFP4 performance vs FP8, Fine-grained FP8 training libraries` 


- **MXFP4 Format Unpacked as U8**: Members discussed that **OpenAI**'s new open-weight model uses **U8** instead of **FP4** in Hugging Face, where the weights are packed as **uint8**, and the scales are actually a **uint8** view of **e8m0**.
   - It was clarified that during inference/training, the weights are unpacked back to **FP4** with a block size of **32** for MXFP4 and **16** for NVFP4.
- **Doubts Arise Over H100 Training Claims**: Doubts were raised about **Nvidia**'s claim that the model was trained on **H100**, as **H100** doesn't natively support **FP4**, according to the [Nvidia blog post](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/rtx-ai-garage-openai-oss/).
- **MXFP4 Simulation on Hopper**: It's suspected that **MXFP4** is software simulated on **Hopper**, referencing a [vLLM blog post](https://blog.vllm.ai/2025/08/05/gpt-oss.html) and linking to [Triton kernels](https://github.com/triton-lang/triton/blob/main/python/triton_kernels/triton_kernels/matmul_ogs.py) that check for hardware support and use **fp16** simulated **mxfp dot** via `dot_scaled`.
   - This simulation is not exclusive to **Hopper** or **mxfp4**, and includes an [operation decomposition](https://github.com/triton-lang/triton/blob/0daeb4f8fc09fcc5819de11746cbf5ff25a0ac4a/lib/Dialect/TritonGPU/Transforms/DecomposeScaledBlocked.cpp) for supported hardware formats.
- **Seeking fine-grained FP8 Training Libraries**: Members discussed the possibility of performance gains using the simulated kernel compared to **FP8** and the need for fine-grained **FP8** training libraries, with a member referencing a [TorchAO pull request](https://github.com/pytorch/ao/pull/1763) that seems to only implement the forward pass.
- **MXFP Dot Product Demystified**: It was clarified that what's simulated is the **MXFP dot product**, where weights are dequantized before an **fp16 x fp16 dot product**, acceptable for weight-only quantization with **fp16** activations.
   - Real **mxfp** in **Blackwell** performs **fp4 x fp4** or **fp8 x fp4** directly as an **mma tensorcore instruction**.

> `Kernel Resource Utilization During Training, DMA Transfers and Memory Usage, Block Swizzling Use Cases, Hierarchical Tiling of Problems` 


- **Kernel Resources Maxed Out, Memory Idle?**: A member observed that during training, **kernel (compute) resources are almost fully utilized, while memory usage remains close to zero** as shown in a provided [image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1189607726595194971/1402640148859977788/image.png?ex=6894a5ef&is=6893546f&hm=7108cf2593d56e1983a11d07002981868d0b13d9c3e1b54c76c0b85e3e44db83&).
   - Another member clarified that *memory* in this context means **DMA transfers (i.e. `cudaMemcpy` and the like)**, and the reported metric does not accurately reflect overall bandwidth utilization.
- **Swizzling Secrets for Global Memory?**: A member inquired about use cases for **swizzling** beyond transferring data from global memory to shared memory and handling vectorized data types for registers.
   - They referenced a [GitHub issue on block swizzling in CUTLASS](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/issues/1017) but sought further clarification.
- **Tiling Threadblocks Hierarchically**: A member explained that the discussion revolves around **hierarchically tiling the problem**, ensuring threadblocks aren't simply assigned tiles in column-major order.
   - The member suggested the [Triton matmul tutorial](https://triton-lang.org/main/getting-started/tutorials/03-matrix-multiplication.html#sphx-glr-getting-started-tutorials-03-matrix-multiplication-py) as a resource offering a superior explanation compared to the CUTLASS issue.

- **WandB houses Pythia and PolyPythia Training Logs**: A member asked if **Pythia** and **PolyPythia** training logs (loss curve, gradient norms, etc.) are open-sourced.
   - Another member stated that the **PolyPythia WandB** should be linked from the GitHub repo and that some of the **Pythia** logs are isolated and linked there as well.
- **"The Alt Man's" Theories hold up**: A member expressed strong agreement with the work of "The Alt Man", noting that his theories and predictions, especially regarding **LLM capabilities** like **multi-hop reasoning** and **composition**, have held up with new empirical evidence.
   - The member added that "The Alt Man" shares the view that the **DL community** has merely *fingers crossed* scaled up large LMs, which are not packing as much capability as theoretically possible, suggesting that **every LLM is undertrained w.r.t. the efficiency of the usage of its parameters**.
- **UTs challenge Transformer Performance**: A member asked about the parameter ratio at which a **UT** (Universal Transformer) can achieve the same performance as a standard **Transformer**.
   - Another member stated that it depends on the **task/architecture/data**, but a rough rule of thumb is that each additional iteration yields only a logarithmic improvement compared to adding fresh parameters to a baseline transformer.
- **Muon Optimizer Mismatch with AdamW Surfaces**: Researchers working on **Kimi models** have encountered a problem training **LLMs** with the **Muon optimizer** due to conflicting mismatch with the **AdamW optimizer** and are seeking insights and relevant research.
   - A member stated that **Muon** is not great for fine-tuning, but another one said it's because *Muon tends to have more aggressive updates* because *pretty much all of the singular values/vectors get updated at each step* and that different optimizers 'like' different hyperparameters.
