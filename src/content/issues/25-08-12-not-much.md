### 2. Open and Uncensored Model Releases: gpt-oss-20b and Unsloth gpt-oss-120b Benchmarks

- [**Uncensored gpt-oss-20b released**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mo1pv4/uncensored_gptoss20b_released/) ([Score: 165, Comments: 57](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mo1pv4/uncensored_gptoss20b_released/)): **Jinx-gpt-oss-20b is an open-weight 20B parameter language model intended to provide uncensored outputs (i.e., avoids safety-related refusals) and is available via HuggingFace [here](https://huggingface.co/Jinx-org/Jinx-gpt-oss-20b). The release framing implies altered or removed refusal mechanisms, but questions arise regarding its training processâ€”whether uncensoring was accomplished by additional fine-tuning, abliteration of safety layers, or modifications of the dataset itself.** Commenters debate whether "uncensoring" has tangible effects if the training data was already scrubbed of sensitive or "unsafe" content, and seek technical details on the approach (e.g., dataset augmentation versus direct model modification).
    - A commenter suggests that the original gpt-oss-20b training dataset may have had "unsafe" or sensitive content removed at the data level, raising the question of whether an "uncensored" model based on this would even contain meaningful uncensored knowledge. This underscores a technical debate on the impact and limitations of post-training "uncensoring" if the underlying data is already sanitized.
    - A user inquires about the technical process for creating an "uncensored" version of a model, specifically asking whether it involves abliteration (replacement or retraining) with a different dataset. This points to possible techniques such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) removal, or merging with datasets that contain previously filtered content.
    - Another user expresses interest in awaiting a 'gguf' (GGML Universal Format) conversion, which would make gpt-oss-20b more easily usable in efficient inference engines like llama.cpp, highlighting a technical consideration for compatibility and deployment across open ML tooling.
- [**Unsloth fixes chat_template (again). gpt-oss-120-high now scores 68.4 on Aider polyglot**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mnxwmw/unsloth_fixes_chat_template_again_gptoss120high/) ([Score: 131, Comments: 43](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mnxwmw/unsloth_fixes_chat_template_again_gptoss120high/)): **Unsloth has updated the chat_template for gpt-oss-120b, resulting in a new high score of 68.4 on the Aider polyglot benchmark (see [Aider details](https://aider.chat/)), achieved with the F16 GGUF model ([download](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/gpt-oss-120b-GGUF/resolve/main/gpt-oss-120b-F16.gguf),** `sha256: c6f818151fa2c6fbca5de1a0ceb4625b329c58595a144dc4a07365920dd32c51`**). The evaluation used an updated [chat_template.jinja](https://huggingface.co/openai/gpt-oss-120b/resolve/main/chat_template.jinja) and rigorous testing across reasoning levels, with high reasoning necessitating significant compute (6 nodes, 2 days), while instructions for local runs and fine-tuning are [documented here](https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/gpt-oss-how-to-run-and-fine-tune). High reasoning tests used** `~10x` **the completion tokens compared to low reasoning; new gguf versions will rerun medium/low if improvements are detected.** Top commenters highlight the model's fast performance, compliance with system prompts, strong STEM/coding capabilities (notably JavaScript/C++), and a lack of apparent censorship, comparing its output quality to OpenAI's GPT-3.5/4 and open models from China. Reproducibility is bolstered by specific inference parameters and a shared template, while the result ('68.4 is insane!') is equated to Sonnet 3.7 level reasoning.
    - gpt-oss-120b demonstrates practical improvements over other open models: it strictly adheres to system prompts (e.g., minimizing tables/lists when instructed), shows strong STEM and code writing capabilities (especially in JavaScript/C++), and operates with high speed and less 'sloppiness' compared to certain Chinese models. Its analogies, while occasionally quirky, avoid clichÃ© patterns found in other systems.
    - Aider polyglot benchmarking gives gpt-oss-120b a score of 68.4, which is noted as approaching the 'Sonnet 3.7 Thinking level'; by contrast, medium and low models score approximately 50.7 and 38.2, respectively. This positions gpt-oss-120b well above other open models in this specific test.

- **Genie 3 Glitters as DeepSeek R2 Goes Ascend**: Developers hyped **Googleâ€™s Genie 3** for interactive generation ([Genie 3](https://ai.google.com/research/genie)) and noted **DeepSeek** shifting to **Ascend** and launching **R2** ([DeepSeek site](https://www.deepseek.com/en)).
    - Some expected **Gemini 3.0** to *"wipe the floor"* with **GPTâ€‘5**, while others cautioned prior **DeepSeek** models were *"too unhinged"*, tempering expectations until benchmarks land.

**5. Systems, Compilers, and GPU Kernel Insights**

- **CuTe Layout Algebra Gets a Corrections Pass**: Engineers flagged a flaw in **CuTe**â€™s layout algebra docs around injectivity and composition conditions, contrasting the official text with clarifications in [CuTe Layout Algebra](https://docs.nvidia.com/cutlass/media/docs/cpp/cute/02_layout_algebra.html) and [Jay Shahâ€™s note](https://leimao.github.io/downloads/article/2024-10-20-CuTe-Layout-Algebra/layout_algebra.pdf).
    - They argued the right conditions include **divisibility** and **disjoint image intervals** per mode, sharpening reasoning about **biâ€‘mode composition** and avoiding subtle indexing bugs.
- **MaxCompiler Meets torch.compile()**: A new backend extends **torch.compile()** with **MaxCompiler** for simple models, aiming eventually at **LLMs** ([maxâ€‘torchâ€‘backend](https://github.com/gabrieldemarmiesse/max-torch-backend)).
    - Contributors left **kernel fusion** and heavy optimizations to **MAX**, noting itâ€™s *"surprisingly hard"* to find **Transformers** code that works cleanly with **torch.compile()**.
- **WebGPU Voxel Renderer Streams Chunks Live**: An openâ€‘source voxel renderer in **Rust** on **WebGPU** now supports **live chunk streaming** while raytracing, shown in this [devlog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcc_x2VU2KA).
    - The project showcases efficient clientâ€‘side rendering pipelines and sparked interest in memory coalescing and access patterns for realâ€‘time graphics on consumer hardware.
