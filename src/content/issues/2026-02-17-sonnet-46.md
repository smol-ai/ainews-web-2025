Despite a lot of rumors of a “Sonnet 5”, Anthropic opted to launch Sonnet 4.6 today, bumping their cheaper workhorse model up to match Opus 4.6, touting some preference wins from Sonnet to 4.5 Opus and a 1m token context, though generally lagging in usual benchmarks, and on GDPVal-AA (below) it uses 4.5x more tokens so the all-in cost can be higher than Opus in some tasks. The API platform tools and the Excel integrations also got minor upgrades.

Some of the key highlights are the long term improvements in Computer Use, first launched in Oct 2024, which was at launch completely slow and so inaccurate as to be impractical, but now is productized as Claude Cowork, which has anecdotally seen more successful adoption than OpenAI’s equivalent Operator and Agent iterations.


We have tuned the Twitter recap below to include more datapoints, but really that’s all that you truly need to know.

## Facts vs opinions (clearly separated)

### Factual / checkable claims (from tweets)

- Sonnet 4.6 is described by Anthropic as a **full upgrade** across multiple capability areas and includes a **1M token context window in beta** [[@claudeai](https://x.com/claudeai/status/2023817132581208353)].  
- Benchmark datapoints cited:
  - **79.6% SWE-Bench Verified**, **58.3% ARC-AGI-2** (as posted) [[@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2023818940112327101)].  
  - “Users preferred Sonnet 4.6 over Opus 4.5 **59%** of the time” [[@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2023819403230671232)].  
  - “Sonnet 4.6 the best model on **GDPval**” (claim) [[@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2023819793212813604)].  
- Artificial Analysis (independent benchmarking org) claims:
  - Sonnet 4.6 reached **GDPval-AA ELO 1633** (in “adaptive thinking mode” and “max effort”), and is **#1** on their GDPval-AA leaderboard but **within the 95% CI of Opus 4.6** [[@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2023821893846135212)].  
  - Token usage to run GDPval-AA: Sonnet 4.6 used **280M total tokens** (vs Sonnet 4.5 **58M**); Opus 4.6 used **160M** in equivalent settings [[@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2023821893846135212)].  
  - Sonnet 4.6 improved *aesthetic* quality of generated docs/presentations relative to 4.5 on GDPval-AA outputs [[@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2023821899139293652)].  
- Tooling update: Anthropic web search/fetch tools now **execute code to filter results**; reported effect: **+13% accuracy on BrowseComp** with **32% fewer input tokens** when enabled (as posted) [[@alexalbert__](https://x.com/alexalbert__/status/2023834863858769975)].  
- Availability / integrations mentioned:
  - **Cursor**: “Sonnet 4.6 is now available in Cursor… notable improvement over 4.5 on longer tasks, but below Opus 4.6 for intelligence” [[@cursor_ai](https://x.com/cursor_ai/status/2023841746577485894)].  
  - **Windsurf** availability [[@cognition](https://x.com/cognition/status/2023821257939317009)].  
  - **Microsoft Foundry** availability [[@Azure](https://x.com/Azure/status/2023833069703041144)].  
  - **Perplexity Pro/Max** availability [[@perplexity_ai](https://x.com/perplexity_ai/status/2023839622242206179)] and **Comet browser agent using Sonnet 4.6** for Pro users [[@comet](https://x.com/comet/status/2023889197556441464)].  

### Opinions / interpretations (what’s *not* settled)

- “Approaching Opus-class capabilities… insane jump” [[@alexalbert__](https://x.com/alexalbert__/status/2023817479580221795)] is qualitative framing (though consistent with some benchmark movement).  
- “Near human-level computer use” extrapolation [[@alexalbert__](https://x.com/alexalbert__/status/2023820589983801796)] depends strongly on which “computer use” evals + harnesses + task distributions are used.  
- “Warmer and kinder… smarter and more overcaffeinated” is pure UX vibe [[@sleepinyourhat](https://x.com/sleepinyourhat/status/2023821754859503650)].  
- “Taste is off the charts” / SVG skyline anecdote is subjective (but points to improved design/visual generation) [[@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2023840565641556439)].  
- Post-launch reliability concerns (“hallucinations everywhere… 4.6 crapping the bed”) are anecdotal reports from a specific workflow, though notable because they compare to 4.5 on the “same tasks” [[@rishdotblog](https://x.com/rishdotblog/status/2023848930430304648)].  


## Technical details extracted (numbers, benchmarks, systems implications)

### Core model/product knobs surfaced in tweets
- **Context window:** **1M tokens (beta)** [[@claudeai](https://x.com/claudeai/status/2023817132581208353)].  
- **Pricing:** “same pricing as Sonnet 4.5” [[@kimmonismus](https://x.com/kimmonismus/status/2023820443359002922)] (no $/tok quoted directly in these tweets, but note RundownAI cites “Sonnet pricing [$3/$15 per mil tokens]” as context [[@TheRundownAI](https://x.com/TheRundownAI/status/2023821446380978238)]).  
- **Search/fetch tool change:** pre-context filtering via executable code; **+13% BrowseComp accuracy, -32% input tokens** [[@alexalbert__](https://x.com/alexalbert__/status/2023834863858769975)].  
  - Systems read: this is an explicit shift toward **tool-side “compute before context”**—spending tool compute to reduce prompt budget and improve signal-to-noise in retrieved context.

### Benchmarks and what they *suggest* (with caveats)
- **SWE-Bench Verified 79.6%** (posted) [[@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2023818940112327101)].  
  - Interpretation: SWE-Bench Verified is sensitive to harness, timeouts, repo setup, and tool reliability. Still, 79.6% is “frontier-tier” in the common discourse.  
- **ARC-AGI-2 58.3%** (posted) [[@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2023818940112327101)].  
  - Also see longitudinal claim: “141 days… 13.6% to 60.4% on ARC-AGI-2” (Sonnet line progress, presumably 4.5→4.6 or earlier→now) [[@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2023850250662969587)].  
- **Preference eval:** “preferred over Opus 4.5 59%” [[@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2023819403230671232)].  
- **GDPval-AA (Artificial Analysis):** ELO **1633**, #1 but statistically overlapping Opus 4.6; **token usage 280M** for Sonnet 4.6 vs 58M for Sonnet 4.5; **cost to run** GDPval-AA “just ahead of Opus 4.6” (because of token usage) [[@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2023821893846135212)].  
  - Important implication for engineers: **“Best” may be bought with more thinking tokens**, which impacts latency and spend; a router may pick 4.6 selectively.  
- **Vending-Bench Arena strategy** claim: with 1M context, Sonnet 4.6 uses a “capacity-first then profitability pivot” plan [[@felixrieseberg](https://x.com/felixrieseberg/status/2023823186484404443)].  
  - This is a rare example of a **behavioral shift** attributed to long-context planning capacity, but it’s still a single benchmark anecdote.

### Cost/latency + throughput signals
- Engineers are explicitly noticing that frontier labs “blast millions of tokens… scaffold like a skyscraper” [[@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2023837889478758495)], aligning with Artificial Analysis’ disclosure that Sonnet 4.6 needed **~4.8×** the tokens of Sonnet 4.5 on GDPval-AA [[@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2023821893846135212)].
- Cursor’s note: Sonnet 4.6 better on “longer tasks” but “below Opus 4.6 for intelligence” [[@cursor_ai](https://x.com/cursor_ai/status/2023841746577485894)] suggests practical routing: Sonnet 4.6 as **default long-horizon workhorse**; Opus as **max-capability**.


## Different perspectives in the dataset

### Strongly positive / “this is a big jump”
- Anthropic-side: “most capable Sonnet… full upgrade… 1M context” [[@claudeai](https://x.com/claudeai/status/2023817132581208353)] and “approaching Opus-class… jump… insane” [[@alexalbert__](https://x.com/alexalbert__/status/2023817479580221795)].  
- Benchmark boosters: SWE-Bench/ARC-AGI-2 callouts [[@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2023818940112327101)], GDPval best-model claim [[@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2023819793212813604)], “crushes Gemini 3 and GPT-5.2 on Vending-Bench 2” [[@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2023833660546499053)].  
- Practitioners: “beast for real-world work… computer usage” [[@kimmonismus](https://x.com/kimmonismus/status/2023844025011499052)], “computer use standout… more consistent over long sessions” [[@mikeyk](https://x.com/mikeyk/status/2023853207731200176)].

### Neutral / adoption & positioning notes
- “no Sonnet 5” reaction [[@dejavucoder](https://x.com/dejavucoder/status/2023817232732848501)] reflects expectations management rather than capability.  
- Cursor’s measured product note (better than 4.5, below Opus 4.6) [[@cursor_ai](https://x.com/cursor_ai/status/2023841746577485894)].  
- Artificial Analysis: #1 GDPval-AA but within CI of Opus 4.6 + disclosure that it uses **more tokens** [[@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2023821893846135212)].

### Negative / skeptical / “something broke”
- Reliability regression report: hallucinated function names in agent workflows; structured output errors; “4.5 still works great” [[@rishdotblog](https://x.com/rishdotblog/status/2023848930430304648)]. Follow-up: “Whatever this was seems fixed!” [[@rishdotblog](https://x.com/rishdotblog/status/2023854279766003784)].  
- Cost sensitivity: “Sonnet and Slopus… munching through my credits” [[@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2023835207355560223)], plus later “price hurts” / cost follow-ups (not fully detailed in provided snippet) [[@scaling01](https://x.com/scaling01/status/2023856013829698037)].  
- A comparative take in infra/product terms: “50% more expensive than xhigh and 228% over 5.2 codex… vast improvement over 4.5” [[@teortaxesTex](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2023890938125488289)]—this frames Sonnet 4.6 as improved but potentially cost-inefficient vs alternatives depending on workload.


## Context: why Sonnet 4.6 matters (engineering implications)

1) **Long-context is becoming “operational,” not just a spec.**  
The launch pushes a **1M token window** into the Sonnet tier [[@claudeai](https://x.com/claudeai/status/2023817132581208353)]. But Artificial Analysis’ disclosure that Sonnet 4.6 used **280M tokens** to run GDPval-AA in “adaptive thinking/max effort” configs [[@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2023821893846135212)] is a reminder: long-context + long-think can silently move your budget envelope. Expect more **routing, summarization, context management, and “retrieve then filter”** patterns (consistent with the new search/fetch filtering improvement [[@alexalbert__](https://x.com/alexalbert__/status/2023834863858769975)]).

2) **Agent performance claims are increasingly harness-dependent.**  
GDPval-AA uses an agentic harness (shell + browsing loop), and Sonnet 4.6’s lead is reported under a specific setup (“adaptive thinking mode”, “max effort”) [[@ArtificialAnlys](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2023821893846135212)]. Cursor’s note that it’s better on longer tasks but below Opus for raw intelligence [[@cursor_ai](https://x.com/cursor_ai/status/2023841746577485894)] reinforces that “best model” is not a scalar; it’s workload × harness × budget.

3) **Computer use is becoming a marquee capability, and Sonnet is being pushed there.**  
Multiple tweets highlight “computer use” progress and near-human-level framing [[@alexalbert__](https://x.com/alexalbert__/status/2023820589983801796)], and deployments like Perplexity’s Comet browser agent explicitly default to Sonnet 4.6 for Pro users [[@comet](https://x.com/comet/status/2023889197556441464)].

4) **Release risk: small serving/config changes can look like “model regressions.”**  
The reported post-launch hallucination spike across Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6 [[@rishdotblog](https://x.com/rishdotblog/status/2023848487285387693)]—and then “seems fixed” [[@rishdotblog](https://x.com/rishdotblog/status/2023854279766003784)]—reads like a potential **routing, toolchain, system prompt, or safety-layer change** rather than weights. For teams: pin versions where possible, run **canary evals**, and monitor **structured output validity** + tool-call correctness separately from “chat quality.”

- **Sonnet 4.6 Goes on Tour, Steals the Coding Crown**: **Claude Sonnet 4.6** shipped broadly and showed up in multiple surfaces: it landed in [LMSYS Arena Text/Vision/Code](https://arena.ai/c/new) (and [Code Arena](https://arena.ai/c/new?chat-modality=code)), became available to [Perplexity Pro and Max subscribers](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1047204950763122820/1473400411498217642/HBYfaVRaMAAmO3K.png?ex=69961290&is=6994c110&hm=70d6cc17b024adb871fcad988b752c2e1120a742ec97d3e35c188678ae31d22f&), and got covered in Anthropic’s release note [“Claude Sonnet 4.6”](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-6).
  - Cursor users echoed the upgrade notes from Anthropic—*“Users even preferred Sonnet 4.6 to Opus 4.5...”*—and Latent Space circulated benchmark claims from the same announcement (e.g., **79.6% SWE-bench**, **59.1% Terminal-Bench 2.0**, and **1M-token context in beta**) while Arena published first impressions in [Peter Gostev’s YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0yr1I0dxA4).

- **Qwen 3.5 and GLM-5 Crash the Party (with Receipts)**: The **qwen3.5-397b-a17b** model joined Arena’s new-model feed on [Text/Vision/Code](https://arena.ai/c/new), and Hugging Face users highlighted a local GGUF option: [unsloth/Qwen3.5-397B-A17B-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3.5-397B-A17B-GGUF).
  - Meanwhile, Nous Research discussed the **GLM-5** technical report ([arXiv:2602.15763](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15763)) alongside a demo [YouTube video showcasing GLM 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtWMgVCMsx8), and Windsurf announced availability via tweet: [“GLM-5 and Minimax M2.5 hit Windsurf!”](https://x.com/windsurf/status/2023536941451669586?s=20).

- **Model Access Whiplash: Limits, Tokens, and Pulling the Turbo**: Moonshot users reported **Kimi K2 Turbo** disappearing from **Kimi-Coding**, triggering subscription backlash (*“...they remove it?!?”*), while OpenClaw users hit **Kimi 2.5** weekly usage ceilings (one claimed **95% in two days**) and discussed switching providers via [OpenRouter models](https://openrouter.ai/models).
  - Perplexity users similarly complained about product-tier constraints—**Deep Research** allegedly dropping from **300/month** to **20/month**—and LMArena users probed ways around a 24-hour video cap but got pushback that the limit is intentional (i.e., don’t try to bypass it).


**2. OpenClaw Agent Systems: Power, Cost, and Risk**

- **OAuth, Bans, and the Agent That Touched the Forbidden API**: OpenClaw users debated whether running **Claude** via OpenClaw violates **Anthropic ToS**, with reports of bans and the claim that *“Using OAuth for unauthorized 3rd party software is considered reverse engineering their networks, and a violation of the Terms of Service.”*
  - The same security anxiety echoed elsewhere: Unsloth and Yannick Kilcher communities flagged the risk of giving an LLM **read+write access** (API key leaks, prompt injection, even *“rm -rf /”*), with OpenClaw’s general approach discussed alongside a demo video [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAbrRTu5xcw).

- **Make the Harness Less 'Bloated Slop' (and Cheaper)**: OpenClaw engineers questioned the system’s **architectural complexity** and **token usage**, arguing *“The harness needs to be built on lightweight sophistication, not bloated slop”* and proposing tactics like heartbeat checks in sub-agents to cut chatter.
  - Showcase builders reported concrete savings from “agentic context engineering” and memory work: ~**30% token reduction** on an **OpenRouter→opus-4.6** setup and **50+%** reduction when using the **OpenClaw Browser Relay**, framing cost as the primary bottleneck vs. local hardware.

- **The OpenClaw Ecosystem Ships: Recipes, CRM Skills, and a Fallback Brain**: A community member open-sourced an OpenClaw “agency server” toolkit after *“north of 200 hours”* of work, publishing [JIGGAI/ClawRecipes](https://github.com/JIGGAI/ClawRecipes) for project management/task distribution and daily tracking of ecosystem events (including ProductHunt finds).
  - Hugging Face also surfaced **Microclaw (v2026.2.17)** as a distilled fallback agent for OpenClaw—[microclaw-for-openclaw-version-2026.2.17 README](https://huggingface.co/webxos/microclaw-for-openclaw-version-2026.2.17/blob/main/README.md)—while others showed “OpenClaw as CRM” via the Nex skill ([nex-crm/nex-as-a-skill](https://github.com/nex-crm/nex-as-a-skill) + [nex-crm/clawgent](https://github.com/nex-crm/clawgent)).


**3. Infra & Security Reality Check (401s, Panics, and Key Leaks)**

- **401 Apocalypse Now: Routers Down, Scripts Cry**: OpenRouter suffered a major incident causing widespread **401 errors** across API surfaces, tracked on [OpenRouter Status](https://status.openrouter.ai/) with the team spinning up a “war room” and later announcing a fix in the OpenRouter announcements thread.
  - Perplexity API users separately reported scripts failing with **401** despite credits, and the best guidance was basic key validation + escalation to [api@perplexity.ai](mailto:api@perplexity.ai), underscoring how auth failures cascade across automation stacks.

- **Inference Endpoints ‘Service Panicked’ (So Users Rebuilt Prod)**: Hugging Face Inference Endpoint users hit **Error 500** and **“Service panicked”** even while [Hugging Face Status](https://status.huggingface.co/) looked green, and at least one team fixed it by recreating the endpoint and migrating production traffic.
  - Members suspected the instability might correlate with new **CPU autoscaling**, which is exactly the kind of “silent platform change” that makes endpoint recreation a pragmatic (if painful) incident playbook.

- **API Keys: Gitignored, Still Toasted**: An OpenRouter user reported an **API key leak** that burned **$10 in ~20 minutes** via “Cloud Code,” despite the key living in a gitignored file and OpenRouter requiring email verification for login.
  - In parallel, OpenClaw + Unsloth discussions highlighted agentic systems as an exfiltration risk multiplier (tools + read/write permissions + prompt injection), making secret-scanning, least-privilege, and runtime key isolation non-optional.


**4. Performance Engineering: Kernels, Quantization Paths, and Fast Toolchains**

- **350→368 TFLOPS: The Matmul Gym Bro Era Continues**: GPU MODE members iterated on persistent-kernel matmul work (350 TFLOPS baseline) in [theCudaBender/matmul_V3](https://github.com/PranavDeepakSathya/theCudaBender/tree/main/matmul_V3) and traded concrete tuning ideas like **async stores** and **smem→rmem pipelining**, citing Cutlass references such as [dense_gemm.py](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/blob/291300ffffa3533a78ee104f08a8490a29ce9ccb/examples/python/CuTeDSL/blackwell_geforce/dense_gemm.py#L738-L756).
  - They also emphasized measurement hygiene: use **Nsight Compute** for qualitative metrics on a single kernel and CUDA Events for real timing, because Nsight’s replay can inflate durations when you profile too much at once.

- **FlashInfer Baseline Drops a 5.74× Speedup (and FP8 Weirdness)**: A GPU MODE participant reported a **5.74× speedup** on the MoE track using [flashinfer-ai/mlsys26-agent-baseline](https://github.com/flashinfer-ai/mlsys26-agent-baseline) (evolve agent, **total_steps=100**, **pool_size=6**, evaluated on **B200**) with **Claude Opus 4.6**.
  - Follow-up questions targeted whether high **max_relative_error/max_absolute_error** is expected for **FP8 kernels** (even when marked correct) and asked about final-eval details like Triton version and workload weighting—classic “fast now, will it pass the judge?” anxiety.

- **FP4 Isn’t One Thing: MXFP4 Wants Blackwell (Ampere Gets the Slow Lane)**: Unsloth users clarified that **MXFP4** is designed for **Blackwell** (RTX 50 series) and can run slower on **Ampere** (RTX 30 series) due to emulation, because the fast path needs **native FP4 tensor cores** (compute capability **≥ 12.00**).
  - Modular’s MAX channel echoed the datatype reality: **NVFP4** is the current focus and **MXFP4 support** is “lagging,” but the types exist in base Mojo and may follow once NVFP4 is solid ([MAX customized Mojo kernels announcement](https://forum.modular.com/t/max-models-can-now-use-customized-mojo-kernels-and-standard-library/2742)).


**5. Benchmarks, Evals, and Agent Protocol Plumbing**

- **Benchmarks Get Audited: ‘Every Eval Ever’ and Cybench’s Flag Fumble**: The EvalEval Coalition launched the benchmark standardization effort [“Every Eval Ever”](https://evalevalai.com/infrastructure/2026/02/17/everyevalever-launch/), with Eleuther members comparing it to the [Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/index.html) standardization push.
  - Nous Research also highlighted how **Cybench** overestimated performance by using non-randomized CTF flags and saw success rates drop after randomization ([Cybench site](https://cybench.github.io)), a reminder that “benchmark design bugs” can dwarf model deltas.

- **KV Cache Goes on a Diet: 160GB → 136MB**: Eleuther shared **CoDA-GQA-L** (bounded-memory attention) claiming KV cache reduction from **160GB to 136MB**, described in a Zenodo paper [“CoDA-GQA-L”](https://zenodo.org/records/18663265) with code at [anthony-maio/CoDA-GQA-L](https://github.com/anthony-maio/CoDA-GQA-L).
  - The mechanism (as summarized in-channel) uses **384 slots/layer** split across a recent window (**256 exact tokens**), a landmark bank (**64 novelty-filtered tokens**), and a summary bank (**64 EMA prototypes**), making it directly relevant to long-context agent stacks where KV dominates cost.

- **MCP Grows Up: Resources Spec Cleanup and Paying Tools**: MCP contributors debated monetization primitives via SEP [modelcontextprotocol PR #2007](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/2007) to let servers request payment (starting with **X402**) so agents can pay for tools under guardrails.
  - In parallel, the community pushed for clarity in resources semantics with a spec tidy-up PR [modelcontextprotocol PR #2093](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/2093), especially around the ambiguity of whether `resource/read` returns a single resource vs. a collection of children.

   - The community is bringing more formality and utility to existing conventions like **URI paths** and sub-resources returned in `resource/read`, without addressing context length issues or UX-based primitive grouping.
- **Resource Grouping Proposal Rejected**: A member noted that [SEP-2084](https://example.com/SEP-2084), which pertained to grouping resources, was rejected because **CMs** were not ready to adopt any grouping proposal at this time.
   - The feedback indicated that any grouping proposal would need to apply to all primitives, not just tools, as was the case with the earlier **SEP-1300**.
- **`resource/read` Functionality Faces Ambiguity**: The community raised concerns that when you `resource/read` a **URI**, it's unclear whether you receive a single resource or a collection of child resources, creating confusion.
   - This ambiguity requires clarification and refinement to ensure predictable behavior when accessing resources.

   - They ran the math and realized training on this would have been cheaper than the **4B** model.
- **MXFP4 runs poorly on older hardware**: MXFP4 is designed for **Blackwell GPUs** (RTX 50 series) and not **Ampere** (RTX 30 series), leading to slower performance on older hardware due to emulation.
   - A breakdown revealed that the fast **MXFP4 path** requires **Blackwell's native FP4 tensor cores** (compute capability ≥ 12.00), with older architectures falling back to slower paths using on-the-fly quantization.
- **Debate QAT & Int4**: Members discussed Quantization Aware Training (QAT) and int4 models, stating QAT makes intuitive sense since it handles edge cases better due to undertrained parts not fully being int4.
   - They confirmed that most people use imatrix int4, and that gGFFs are way fatter than they seem from a BPW (bits per weight) perspective.
- **Unsloth's Purpose Clarified**: Users clarified that Unsloth is mainly for *finetuning models*, not for inference, with a recommendation to use at least *3-bit precision* for best performance.
   - Despite Unsloth uploading GGUFs, the major makers GGUFs are largely equivalent.
- **Innovative Bots Detect Bots**: The group discussed strategies for bot detection, including using an LLM-connected bot to conduct an inverse Turing test via DM, requiring users to prove they are human.
   - Ultimately, the team concluded that using a bot would create bad UX as a method of preventing bad UX.

> `Dynamic Memory File Systems, NVIDIA PersonaPlex-7B, Evolution of RL Research, Muon vs. Shampoo Optimizers, Rubric-Based RL` 


- **Dynamic Memory Filesystems get the Nod**: The author argues that AI agent memory should shift from upfront context window loading to a dynamic file system approach as explained in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.06053).
   - They propose organizing context into a structured namespace (**scratchpad, episodic, and fact tiers**) and giving agents tools to list, read, and search these 'files' on demand to prevent memory loss during compaction and improve context debuggability.
- **NVIDIA's Voice Model Speaks Up**: NVIDIA has released **PersonaPlex-7B**, an open-source **7-billion parameter voice model** capable of full-duplex communication.
   - This model allows for **simultaneous listening and speaking** without the need for traditional turn-taking.

> `Browser interaction in pi, surf-cli native host issue, Arc Browser configuration, Codex App Performance, Refactoring` 


- **Debugging Browser Interaction in Pi**: A member sought assistance with browser interaction in Pi, specifically citing issues with `Surf` and native host disconnection, and others pointed to `pi-web-browse`, `pi-agent-browser` and `pi-browser` packages as possible solutions.
   - The user noted concerns about using these extensions due to potential instability on startup after updates and suggested using *playwright*.
- **Surf-CLI Native Host Fix**: A user encountered a *'Native host disconnected: Specified native messaging host not found'* error with `surf-cli` and resolved it by copying the `surf.browser.host.json` manifest to Arc's native messaging host directory as a workaround.
   - The solution involved creating the directory (`mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/Arc/User\ Data/NativeMessagingHosts/`) and copying the manifest from Chrome's location (`cp ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/surf.browser.host.json ~/Library/Application\ Support/Arc/User\ Data/NativeMessagingHosts/`).
- **Arc Browser Native Messaging Host Config**: The core problem was that Arc browser stores its NativeMessagingHosts in a different path than Chrome: Chrome uses `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/`, Arc uses `~/Library/Application Support/Arc/User Data/NativeMessagingHosts/`.
   - Running `surf install` registers the native messaging host for Chrome's path but not Arc's so Arc can't find the host and reports the error.
- **Codex App Experiencing Lagginess**: One member mentioned starting to use the [Codex App](https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-codex-app/) with extra usage credits, but another user noted that it becomes *extremely laggy* once a thread exceeds a few chats and consumes a ton of CPU.
   - They alternate its use due to these performance issues.
- **Refactoring advice from OpenAI Peter**: In a discussion of refactoring and technical debt, a member linked to [OpenAI Peter's writing on constant refactoring](https://steipete.me/posts/just-talk-to-it).
   - The article is about the value of cleaning up code constantly.

- ****Anthropic**'s conditions on **Claude** military use revealed**: **Anthropic** agreed to military use of **Claude**, but with conditions: 1) no mass surveillance, and 2) no autonomous weapons.
   - Some expressed surprise that **Anthropic** took a firm stance, as one member stated, *Didn't expect anthropic to stand their ground*.
- **Lucidrains' GitHub account faces ban-hammer**: Members reported that [Lucidrains' GitHub account](https://gitlab.com/lucidrains) was suspended for some reason, prompting concern within the community.
   - Speculation arose regarding the reasons, including a ban *fsr (for some reason)*, with one member joking it was because he *Made too many other people look bad by comparison*.
- **AI coding faces hostilities**: A member noted *a huge amount of hostility towards AI coding* and reported having three Reddit accounts suspended this week after mentioning **Codex** or **ChatGPT**.
   - This suggests a growing tension or concern within online communities regarding the increasing capabilities and presence of AI in coding and related fields.
- ****Qwen3** model eval numbers disputed**: Members reported discrepancies with their own evaluations using the eval harness.
   - The member asked, *Are these evals somewhere with results/scripts in the repo?*.

> `Geometric Table Transformer (TV-Cache), Every Eval Ever project, CoDA-GQA-L: Bounded-Memory Attention, Mycelium AI Model Benchmarking` 


- ****Geometric Table Transformer** Decouples Semantics from Geometry**: A member is experimenting with a way to decouple semantic compatibility from geometric rotation in the attention mechanism called **Geometric Table Transformer (TV-Cache)**, replacing the high-dimensional dot product of RoPE with an O(1) scalar lookup + trig modulation as described in [this post](https://github.com/MrPan2048/GeometricTransformer/blob/main/lookup/lookup.md).
   - The key advantage is that *attention speed is now independent of D, allowing for scaling internal dimensions without the O(D) compute penalty in the attention head*.
- ****Every Eval Ever** Project Launched**: The **EvalEval Coalition** launched the [Every Eval Ever project](https://evalevalai.com/infrastructure/2026/02/17/everyevalever-launch/) which standardizes benchmark evaluations.
   - Another member noted that it reminds them of the push to standardize BIDS in cognitive neuroscience research via the [Brain Imaging Data Structure](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/index.html).
- ****CoDA-GQA-L** Caps KV Cache Size with Bounded-Memory Attention**: A member released **CoDA-GQA-L**, an attention mechanism that caps KV cache at a fixed size regardless of sequence length reducing KV cache size from 160GB to 136MB, documented in [this paper](https://zenodo.org/records/18663265) with code available [on GitHub](https://github.com/anthony-maio/CoDA-GQA-L).
   - It uses **384 slots per layer**, comprised of *a recent window (256 exact tokens), an exact landmark bank (64 novelty-filtered important tokens), and a summary bank (64 EMA prototypes compressing older context)*.
- **Mycelium Seeks Advice on **AI Model Benchmarking** Paper**: The team at [Mycelium](https://github.com/Mycelium-tools) is looking to publish a paper based on benchmarking AI models, adapting existing benchmarks like [inspect_evals](https://ukgovernmentbeis.github.io/inspect_evals/evals/safeguards/ahb/) to run dynamically generated multi-turn conversations and evaluate AI agents.
   - They are seeking advice on *what journals or conferences they should aim for, to most impactfully disseminate their work*.

> `Preventative Steering, Data Augmentation, Representation Mapping, Model Behavior Control` 


- **Preventative Steering Gets Generalized!**: The concept of **preventative steering**, initially described in Anthropic's persona vectors paper, can be generalized by adding a steering vector while judging the model based on its ability to hit the original target, forcing the model to compensate against the steering vector.
   - By **changing the target**, models can be encouraged to do more than just fight against a steering vector, especially if features can be used as targets.
- **Data Augmentation Via Steering Vectors!**: The idea of using **steering vectors for data augmentation** was explored, addressing the limitation of only obtaining two different data versions by changing the target.
   - The steering vector acts as a **perturbation**, and the targeted feature is what the model should aim for when the perturbation occurs in the data, allowing for exploration of compositions of perturbations rare in the empirical dataset.
- **Mapping Representations Instead of I/O**: An argument was made that instead of training models to map inputs to outputs (expensive and bad), we could train them to map from **representations to representations**, effectively achieving data augmentation in representation space.
   - This would allow precomputing the first part of the forward pass and reusing it with multiple steering vectors aimed at different targets.
- **Controlling Model Behavior Via Internal Semantics!**: The idea of *"If [Semantics X internally] then do [Semantics Y internally]"* offers a ton of control over model behavior and frees us from the dependence on data, according to [this tweet](https://fxtwitter.com/MatthieuWyart/status/2023673502411153421).
   - Also mentioned was [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15029) in relation to internal semantics.

> `LayoutTensor vs InlineArray, Mojo Random Number Generators, Mojo C++ Binding Status, Async on GPUs` 


- **`stack_allocation` Loses Origin Safety**: `stack_allocation` loses origin safety and exclusivity checking versus `InlineArray`, plus it won't allow you to take advantage of noalias optimizations.
   - It's a *crutch* due to compiler limitations, with better options coming soon.
- **Registers on GPU**: An `InlineArray` or `stack_allocation` indexed only by constant values will be stored in registers on the GPU, assuming you didn’t spill.
   - The compiler may optimize trivial register passable types for register use.
- **Mojo needs Random Number Generators**: A member is looking for implementations of Random Number Generators, specifically **Poisson**, for common probability distributions in Mojo.
   - Another member suggested that this need might be interesting for Mojo.
- **Async Await on GPU's**: A blogpost about implementing [Async/Await on GPUs](https://www.vectorware.com/blog/async-await-on-gpu/) might be interesting for Mojo, since it is in flux.
   - This also provides a motivation for having a nice way to do **cold-start futures**, since this approach may not work with hot-start futures.
- **Mojo Binding Status to C++**: Mojo mostly supports round-trip C++ binding via **C with manual bindings**.
   - It is not as easy as with **pybind11**, especially since you need to write the bindings by hand.

- **MXFP4 support lagging in MAX**: MXFP4 support in MAX is lagging because the team is focusing on **NVFP4** first, but there's nothing fundamentally blocking support as the datatypes are present in base Mojo.
   - Once support for NVFP4 is solid, MXFP4 might follow quickly, with testing and tuning happening at the model level.
- **MAX Models now with Customized Mojo Kernels**: MAX graphs and models built using the OSS `modular` repo can now use a fully customized Mojo standard library or Mojo kernels due to enhancements in the build infrastructure and new capabilities in the graph compiler, announced in [this forum post](https://forum.modular.com/t/max-models-can-now-use-customized-mojo-kernels-and-standard-library/2742).

   - Concerns were raised about whether payment support should be built into the protocol, versus handled via URL elicitation.
- **MCP payments unlikely**: A member mentioned payments won't be prioritized in the next few months unless a core maintainer is deeply in favor, preferring to wait for established payment patterns.
   - The author of the SEP asked if any core maintainers are looking into payments, tagging a member to take a look.
- **Micropayments for Agents discussed**: A member explained the proposal focuses on **micropayments** for agents to autonomously pay for tools, requiring rich cost information for intelligent decision-making under guardrails.
   - The member doesn't anticipate new payment protocols for MTXns anytime soon.
- **MCP Extension Planned?**: A member expressed strong agreement with the hesitation toward incorporating payments directly into the protocol, but offered to work with the SEP author on an *unofficial extension* initially.
   - They offered to review the SEP in depth.

   - The PR attempts to clarify some of the murkiness around the specification and usability of resources in **MCP**.
- **SEP-2084 Faced Rejection Over Grouping Proposal**: A member pointed out that [SEP-2084](https://example.com/SEP-2084) related to grouping resources had been rejected because **CMs** didn't want to buy into any grouping proposal at this time.
   - The precursor to that **SEP** was **SEP-1300**, which only focused on grouping tools, but explicit feedback was that any grouping proposal would need to apply to all primitives.
- **Resource Hierarchy Already Exists Implicitly**: A member argued that resources already implicitly have hierarchy in the form of a **URI path** or by returning sub-resources in `resource/read`.
   - The pull request is mostly bringing more formality and utility to these existing conventions, not attempting to solve problems around context length or grouping primitives by category for **UX** purposes.
- **`resource/read` Functionality Faces Ambiguity**: The user raises a flag that when you `resource/read` a **URI**, you don't know whether you get a single resource back or a collection of child resources.
   - This is confusing and needs clarification and refinement.
