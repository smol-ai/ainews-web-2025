<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->**a quiet weekend and [air conditioning](https://x.com/doomie/status/1843380556802994422) is all you need.**

> AI News for 10/4/2024-10/7/2024. We checked 7 subreddits, [**433** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **31** Discords (**226** channels, and **5768** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **640 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

Multiple notable things, but nothing headline worthy:

- [Cursor was on Lex Fridman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFfVt3S51T4), the first time 4 guests have been on the show at once and a notable break for Lex for covering a developer tool + an early stage startup. [Imrat's 20 point summary](https://x.com/imrat/status/1843368797417418766) of the podcast was handy.
- There is a lot of interest in "open o1" reproductions. Admittedly, none are RL based: Most are [prompting techniques](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1fx51z4/i_made_claude_35_sonnet_to_outperform_openai_o1/) and [finetunes](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1fxf5n3/introducing_my_reasoning_model_no_tags_just_logic/), but the most promising project could be [entropix](https://x.com/scaling01/status/1842930165053276272?s=46)  which uses [entropy-based sampling](https://notes.haroldbenoit.com/ml/llms/inference/sampling/entropy-based-sampling) to insert pause tokens.
