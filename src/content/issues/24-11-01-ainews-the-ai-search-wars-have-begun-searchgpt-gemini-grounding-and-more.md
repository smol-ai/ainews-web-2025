Teased as [SearchGPT in July](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SearchGPT), ChatGPT finally rolled out its search functionality today across all platforms, [completely coincidentally](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-gemini-pro-and-gpt4t-vision-go-ga-on-the/) coinciding with [Gemini launching Search Grounding](https://x.com/OfficialLoganK/status/1852032947714510860) after [an unfortunate delay]( https://x.com/apples_jimmy/status/1852063620240413103?s=46).  The launch includes [a simple Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chatgpt-search/ejcfepkfckglbgocfkanmcdngdijcgld?pli=1) that @sama is personally promoting on Twitter and on [their Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1ggixzy/ama_with_openais_sam_altman_kevin_weil_srinivas/) (dont bother) today:

with a raft of weather, stocks, sports, news, and maps partners — noticeably, you will never get a New York Times article via ChatGPT because [the NYT chose to sue OpenAI](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/08/openai-responds-to-new-york-times-lawsuit.html) instead of partner with them. Partners are presumably happy about the feature, but the citations come with a catch - you have to expend an additional click to see them at all, and most will not.

CHatGPT search uses a "*fine-tuned version of GPT-4o, post-trained using novel synthetic data generation techniques, including distilling outputs from OpenAI o1-preview*", however it is already found to [offer hallucinations](https://x.com/altryne/status/1852045015050260703).

This latest salvo in consumer AI plays challenging their search leader (Perplexity) mirrors a broader trend in b2b AI  plays ([Dropbox Dash](https://x.com/FanaHOVA/status/1847316954077684021)) challenging their search leader (Glean).

Sounds like a good time to bone up on AI search techniques, with today's AINews sponsor!
