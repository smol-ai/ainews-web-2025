description: >-
  A tutorial on leveraging large language models (LLMs) with **PyEnsign**, an
  open-source data streaming tool, will provide hands-on experience in building
  real-time NLP model pipelines, presented by **Rebecca Bilbro, PhD** and
  **Prema Roman**. Additionally, there is community interest in vision
  transformers for image processing, with shared PyTorch implementations and
  resources.
