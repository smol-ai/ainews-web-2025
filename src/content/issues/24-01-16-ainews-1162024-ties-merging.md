<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->> We checked **19** guilds, **284** channels, and **4372** messages for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **460 minutes**. Notice a jump? We added TheBloke's Discord today... and it's ultra active. We'll have to figure out how to balance this. We've also tweaked the prompts to make the summaries more informative.

As highlighted in recent issues, model merging is top of everyone's minds. We featured [Maxime Labonne's writeup](https://huggingface.co/blog/mlabonne/merge-models#2-ties) 2 days ago, and [the TIES paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01708) is now making the rounds again.
