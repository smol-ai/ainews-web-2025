# AI Reddit Recap

## /r/LocalLlama + /r/localLLM Recap

### 1. Grok 4 Release: System Prompt Leak and Benchmarks

- [**SYSTEM PROMPT LEAK FOR GROK 4**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lw7yxp/system_prompt_leak_for_grok_4/) ([Score: 227, Comments: 81](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lw7yxp/system_prompt_leak_for_grok_4/)): **A user shared the full system prompt allegedly from Grok 4 by xAI, outlining its abilities—such as analyzing X (Twitter) user profiles, posts, and user-uploaded content (images, PDFs, text), but requiring confirmation before image generation. The prompt directs the model to refer users to official links for subscription pricing or API details, emphasizes up-to-date knowledge, structured mathematical reasoning, comprehensive source-gathering for controversial issues, and instructs not to disclose the guidelines unless asked. Technical context links to the actual prompt repository on GitHub: [grok-prompts](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-prompts).** Commenters note that this information is not an actual leak as such prompts are public on GitHub, with consensus that LLM prompt policies should be openly available. The importance of transparent model instructions upon request was highlighted as good practice.
    - The so-called 'leak' of the Grok 4 system prompt is not actually unauthorized; the prompts are openly published on GitHub by xai-org (see https://github.com/xai-org/grok-prompts). This practice suggests transparency and intentional sharing of prompt data rather than an exploit or breach.
    - Several commenters clarify that, per the prompt's own instructions and public disclosure, users are allowed to request and receive the guidelines explicitly. This implies that any sensitive or proprietary instructions are intentionally omitted from the public prompt, and the company is not obscuring essential safety or instruction logic.
    - There is technical curiosity about the availability of model weights for Grok versions 2 and 3, with some users expecting open sourcing of previous models concurrent with Grok 4’s API release, highlighting expectations within the community for greater transparency or reproducibility.
- [**Grok 4 Benchmarks**](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lw4eej) ([Score: 180, Comments: 153](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lw4eej/grok_4_benchmarks/)): **xAI announced its latest high-performance AI models, Grok 4 and Grok 4 Heavy, targeting the premium subscription market with Grok 4 Heavy priced at $300/month. Benchmarks are referenced but specific results or methodology are not detailed; community anticipation centers on empirical validation and access to prior models' weights, particularly Grok 3.** Technical skepticism dominates, with users questioning the validity of presented benchmarks and raising transparency concerns regarding model weights and reproducibility.
    - There is skepticism expressed about the benchmark results for Grok 4, with concerns about their validity and a lack of trust in the reported performance numbers. This highlights the importance of external validation and transparent methodology when releasing new benchmark results for language models.
    - The question of open-sourcing and sharing model weights is raised, specifically regarding Grok 3. This is relevant for researchers and practitioners interested in reproducibility, benchmarking, and further model development based on existing architectures.

### 2. New Model and MoE Announcements (OpenAI, GLM-4, Mistralai, Phi)

- [**Possible size of new the open model from openai**](https://i.redd.it/622w5dyvhxbf1.png) ([Score: 336, Comments: 101](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lvwya4/possible_size_of_new_the_open_model_from_openai/)): **The image is a screenshot of a Twitter exchange discussing the hardware requirements of an upcoming OpenAI open model. One participant states the model is 'not a small model' and would require H100 GPUs, indicating high resource needs. Commenters question if this applies to full-precision (FP) loading, noting that even a 14B parameter model can require an H100 in FP, and raise the important technical point about whether quantization (e.g., Q4 quant) would reduce the requirements enough to run it on less powerful hardware.** Commenters are skeptical of the source, pointing out the poster's lack of direct involvement with OpenAI and expressing concern over relying on tweet screenshots for technical info. There is also some debate over the relevance of the benchmark/size ratio, with skepticism about the model's performance relative to o3-mini.
    - Several comments discuss the hardware requirements for running the new OpenAI model, especially when quantized at Q4. There's speculation that even a ~14B parameter model in full precision would require high-end GPUs such as the Nvidia H100, whereas Q4 quantization could potentially allow it to run on more accessible hardware like a MacBook Pro with 128GB RAM or an RTX PRO 6000 with 96GB VRAM.
    - There is skepticism about source credibility, as some users question the reliability of information sourced from tweet screenshots and note that early-stage cloud startup operators are unlikely to have privileged access to OpenAI internals, suggesting any model size or benchmark claims should be treated cautiously until official specifications or release.
    - The discussion references performance benchmarks with comparisons to models like o3-mini and o4-mini, raising concerns that if the model benchmarks only at the o3-mini level, it may be considered inadequate by community standards. There's interest in seeing if the model can offer better performance after quantization while fitting into realistic consumer or prosumer hardware environments.
- [**GLM-4 MoE incoming**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lw71av/glm4_moe_incoming/) ([Score: 132, Comments: 23](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lw71av/glm4_moe_incoming/)): **A pull request has been submitted to add support for the GLM-4 MoE (Mixture-of-Experts) model to the vLLM framework, specifically referencing THUDM's** `GLM-4-MoE-100B-A10` **model, which is considered promising in terms of raw capability ([GitHub PR](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/20736)). The GLM-4-MoE model is a 100B parameter architecture designed for efficient inference on A100 GPUs, leveraging MoE for increased scalability and performance within the vLLM system.** Commenters highlight a key technical shortcoming: the context window and context handling of the GLM-4-MoE model is currently subpar, reportedly performing worse than the previous GLM-4-0414-32b, which already had limited context management abilities.
    - The GLM-4-MoE-100B-A10 checkpoint from THUDM has surfaced, suggesting the model is either in release or under active development, prompting interest about its architecture and scaling implications. Insights reference the official repository, pointing to notable technical changes that make it promising for evaluation.
    - Anecdotal benchmarking reports that while the experimental GLM-4-MoE model—possibly as seen on [chat.z.ai](http://chat.z.ai/)—demonstrates strong raw capabilities, its context management is notably poor, reportedly performing worse than the "already unimpressive context handling of GLM-4-0414-32b," thus representing a current limitation for tasks requiring extended context windows.

This architecture achieves notable improvements: *linear prefiling time complexity*, up to** `10x higher throughput`**, enhanced scalability, and superior long-context reasoning compared to conventional transformer or attention-based models. The model is trained on** `5T` **synthetic tokens and finetuned on** `150B` **synthetic math-focused tokens (produced by a larger model, Deepseek-R1), excelling on benchmarks such as AIME24/25, Math500, and GPQA Diamond, and guiding use toward math-only applications for edge or latency-sensitive scenarios. A [detailed diagram](https://preview.redd.it/pvklagkq0zbf1.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5954cb29375294c94699d7106f6f2efe2dce0fc) illustrates its decoder structure.** Commenters note transparency in dataset provenance (synthetic, from Deepseek-R1), question if SambaY surpasses other efficient large models like Gemma 3 12B, and express technical interest in the GMU's role in improving both throughput and long-context reasoning.
    - Phi-4-mini-flash-reasoning is built on the SambaY architecture, which introduces the Gated Memory Unit (GMU) for efficient inter-layer representation sharing. Technical highlights include a self-decoder that fuses Mamba State Space Models with Sliding Window Attention and a full attention layer, plus a cross-decoder that interleaves cross-attention with GMUs. These innovations yield linear prefiling time complexity, improved long-context handling, and up to 10x throughput increases, targeting efficient scaling and strong multi-tasking performance.
    - The training dataset consists solely of synthetic mathematical reasoning content generated by Deepseek-R1, a larger and more advanced reasoning model. This approach departs from large-scale real-world (e.g., web-based) datasets, focusing pretraining only on synthetic reasoning data rather than the entire typical multi-terabyte corpus.
    - There is an open question about how Phi-4-mini-flash-reasoning compares to other compact reasoning models, such as Gemma 3 12B. No empirical benchmarks or direct comparisons are cited in-thread, highlighting a gap in current performance evaluation.

> `SAE Latent Monitoring, Emergent Alignment, Emergence Definition, Behavioral Analysis` 


- **SAE Latent Beats Black-Box Monitoring Sometimes**: A member noted that monitoring the **SAE latent** sometimes outperformed some **black-box monitoring**.
   - They clarified that the main part of the relevant paper is interpreting rather than trying to detect.
- **Emergent Alignment Examined**: Members speculated on the extent to which emergent *alignment* happens, suggesting that training a model to be better at a purely logical task might increase prosocial behavior, referencing [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15468).
   - One member suspects this is rare, pointing to the dynamic where the easiest way to worsen a task is to adopt an antisocial persona, while improving requires simply learning the task.
- **Debate over the Definition of Emergence**: Members discussed the definition of *emergence*, noting that it's a highly misused word, and the vagueness eventually leads to circular thinking.
   - One member stated that *unexpected* nature is a **skill issue**, more than something to seek.
- **Expected Alignment is also a Thing**: Alignment could also be *expected* and *un-emergent*, such as **behavioral analysis**, which is what people do by asking unrelated questions and documenting its misalignment.
   - A member would expect that finetuning a helpful-only model on data where it cares a lot about humans would lead to such generalization.

> `MCQTemplateConfig for structuring tasks, BBH task YAML files, Mixed precision argument for HFLMs, LM-Eval Harness performance issues` 


- **Crafting MCQTemplateConfig for Structured Tasks**: A member is creating templates to easily structure tasks using `MCQTemplateConfig`, enabling format transformations (e.g., MMLU -> cloze) by switching `TemplateConfig`.
   - Another member suggested that the *choice list* should also come with a *'doc to'* option.
- **BBH Task YAML Files Need Editing**: The **BBH task YAML files** in `lm-evaluation-harness` contain an error where both the `doc_to_text` and `target` for each sample repeat the phrase *'Let's think step by step.'*
   - This error is present in 26 YAML files and can be fixed by removing the redundant text from the `target` entries under `samples`.
- **Adding Mixed Precision Argument for HFLMs**: A member proposed a `mixed_precision` argument for **HFLMs** in the harness to automatically wrap model calls inside `autocast` regions for mixed dtype models, benefiting users integrating the harness into their training codebases.
   - This enhancement would be particularly useful when loading a multi-dtype model from the CLI.
- **Diagnosing LM-Eval Harness Performance**: A user reported that **LM-Eval Harness** is taking an extended amount of time (**22 minutes**) for Hellaswag 0-shot on a local llama2 7b fine-tune, despite having a specified device map (cuda:4) and auto batch size.
   - It was suggested that the issue might be due to loading the model in **FP32** instead of **FP16/BF16**, and the user was advised to check the model's dtype and ensure it is cast correctly before saving.

   - The user highlighted that the only difference between the configurations with and without TE is the code block related to **Transformer Engine** settings.
- **Transformer Engine Install Troubles**: A user noted that the **TFLOPs** are significantly lower with **TE** (240.4 TFLOPS) compared to without **TE** (373.7 TFLOPS), suspecting an issue with the **TE installation**.
   - The user was advised to try using a torch NGC container to rule out installation problems and potential fallback to a poor attention implementation.
- **NGC Container Route for TE Setup**: After suspecting issues, a user inquired if the [containerized setup methods](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox?tab=readme-ov-file#containerized-setup) are updated to handle **TE** and if the **Singularity/Apptainer** route is tested with **TE**.
   - The user planned to use Singularity/Apptainer but can also use Docker.
- **Log Analysis for Poor Attention Impl**: The user asked if there are any specific log messages that might indicate a *fall back to a poor attention implementation*.
   - It was pointed out that the logs were not available, as they weren't in the WandB report and the models appeared to be private.

> `Grok's Hitler Aversion, Emergent Misalignment, Linear Reasoning Models, RAG vs Graph augmentation, Trillion Token Training` 


- **Grok's Hitlerpilled Tendencies Surface?**: Members speculated that **Grok's** alleged affinity for **Hitler** could stem from training on right-wing data or RLHF, potentially triggering undesirable persona traits.
   - Others debated whether this behavior was spontaneous or induced by prompts, given **Grok's** marketing stance against safetyism and value-based finetuning.
- **Emergent Misalignment paper cited**: A member cited the paper [Emergent Misalignment: Narrow finetuning can produce broadly misaligned LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17424) to explain how LLMs can develop unwanted behaviors from seemingly minor training data.
   - Another user responded, saying that they're *seeing this paper being cited often* in the AI Alignment community.
- **Linear Reasoning Models: Fact or Fiction?**: A member inquired about the existence of true linear **O(n)** reasoning models, sparking discussion on whether modern Attention implementations achieve this in practice.
   - Another user noted that *modern Attention is way closer to linear than the vanilla Attention* and that **Flash Attention** and **Multi-headed Latent Attention** should be re-read.
- **GNN + RAG?**: The conversation shifted towards augmenting LLMs with external GNN networks with retrieval mechanisms, knowledge graph based systems, or new networks based on graph topologies as superior alternatives to simple **RAG**.
   - One member mentioned that modern Attention is much closer to being linear than Attention as described in the original 'Attention is All You Need' paper.

   - One member joked about comparing apples and oranges to highlight the silliness of conflating LLM and human compression.
- **LLMs Struggle to Grasp Humor**: Humor is based on **sudden onset surprisal**, which is the exact opposite of what LLMs do, as LLMs raise the temperature and increases the surprisal everywhere and not a sudden shift of context and mode.
   - LLMs would need **Poisson (more generally, Hawke) distributions** to represent sudden shift of context and mode.
- **EnergyMatching GitHub Repo Implementation Released**: The implementation for [EnergyMatching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10612) ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/m1balcerak/EnergyMatching/)) was released.

- **DeepHermes Knowledge Cutoff Disclosed**: The knowledge cutoff date for **Deephermes preview** depends on the base model, likely around **December 2023** since the smaller deephermes models are **Llama 3.1** based.
   - The exact cutoff for the **24b Deep Hermes model** remains uncertain.
- **DeepHermes context length clarified**: The context length depends on the base model; finetuning used at least **8k tokens** for older models, possibly closer to **16k** now.
   - The **Llama** based models (**3b** and **8b**) are trained for **128k** but realistically handle up to **16k**, while the **24b** model should be around **32k**.
- **Huge Context Length at low params**: Models claiming huge context lengths at low parameters tend to break down after a certain point.
   - There were no links or discussion about external work to resolve this limitation.
