# AI Twitter Recap


**OpenAI’s Codex push (GPT‑5.3‑Codex) + “You can just build things” as a product strategy**

- **Super Bowl moment → Codex as the wedge**: OpenAI ran a Codex-centric Super Bowl ad anchored on “You can just build things” ([OpenAI](https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/2020649757434327362); coverage in [@gdb](https://twitter.com/gdb/status/2020651347293716694), [@iScienceLuvr](https://twitter.com/iScienceLuvr/status/2020650521758179561)). The meta-story across the tweet set is that “builder tooling” (not chat) is becoming the mainstream consumer interface for frontier models.
- **Rollout and distribution**: OpenAI announced **GPT‑5.3‑Codex** rolling out across **Cursor, VS Code, and GitHub** with phased API access, explicitly flagging it as their **first “high cybersecurity capability”** model under the Preparedness Framework ([OpenAIDevs](https://twitter.com/OpenAIDevs/status/2020921792941166928); amplification by [@sama](https://twitter.com/sama/status/2020940847190356092) and rollout rationale [@sama](https://twitter.com/sama/status/2020940848159130094)). Cursor confirmed availability and preference internally (“noticeably faster than 5.2”) ([cursor_ai](https://twitter.com/cursor_ai/status/2020921643145519249)).
- **Adoption metrics + developer growth loop**: Sam Altman claimed **1M+ Codex App downloads in the first week** and **60%+ weekly user growth**, with intent to keep free-tier access albeit possibly reduced limits ([@sama](https://twitter.com/sama/status/2020977975081177343)). Multiple dev posts reinforce a “permissionless building” narrative, including Codex being used to port apps to iOS/Swift and menu bar tooling ([@pierceboggan](https://twitter.com/pierceboggan/status/2020616390974353880), [@pierceboggan](https://twitter.com/pierceboggan/status/2020986458455277986)).
- **Real-world friction points**: Engineers report that 5.3 can still be overly literal in UI labeling ([kylebrussell](https://twitter.com/kylebrussell/status/2020927139546358171)), and rollout hiccups are acknowledged (paused rollout noted by VS Code account later) ([code](https://twitter.com/code/status/2021041639926673503)). There’s also ecosystem tension around model availability/partnership expectations (e.g., Cursor/OpenAI dynamics debated) ([Teknium](https://twitter.com/Teknium/status/2020659530162692568), later contradicted by actual rollout landing).

**Claude Opus 4.6, “fast mode,” and evals moving into a post-benchmark era**

- **Opus 4.6 as the “agentic generalist” baseline**: A recurring theme is that **Claude Opus 4.6** is perceived as the strongest overall interactive agent, while Codex is closing the gap for coding workflows (summarized explicitly by [natolambert](https://twitter.com/natolambert/status/2020885646555107619) and his longer reflection on “post-benchmark” model reading [natolambert](https://twitter.com/natolambert/status/2020881482873811070)).
- **Leaderboard performance with important caveats**: Opus 4.6 tops both **Text** and **Code Arena** leaderboards, with Anthropic holding 4/5 in Code Arena top 5 in one snapshot ([arena](https://twitter.com/arena/status/2020956227795288132)). On the niche **WeirdML** benchmark, Opus 4.6 leads but is described as **extremely token-hungry** (average ~32k output tokens; sometimes hitting 128k cap) ([htihle](https://twitter.com/htihle/status/2020845875447074874); discussion by [scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/2020847174909665712)).
- **Serving economics and “fast mode” behavior**: Several tweets focus on throughput/latency economics and the practical experience of different serving modes (e.g., “fast mode” for Opus, batch-serving discussions) ([kalomaze](https://twitter.com/kalomaze/status/2020747180408230142), [dejavucoder](https://twitter.com/dejavucoder/status/2020803250920808493)).
- **Practical agent-building pattern**: People are building surprisingly large apps with agent SDKs (e.g., a local agentic video editor, ~10k LOC) ([omarsar0](https://twitter.com/omarsar0/status/2020912965885538664)). The throughline is that models are “good enough” that *workflow design*, tool choice, and harness quality dominate.

**Recursive Language Models (RLMs): long-context via “programmatic space” and recursion as a capability multiplier**

- **Core idea (2 context pools)**: RLMs are framed as giving models a second, **programmatic context space** (files/variables/tools) plus the token space, with the model deciding what to bring into tokens—turning long-context tasks into coding-style decomposition ([dbreunig](https://twitter.com/dbreunig/status/2020723909491114294), [dbreunig](https://twitter.com/dbreunig/status/2020723910724174283)). This is positioned as a generally applicable *test-time* strategy with lots of optimization headroom ([dbreunig](https://twitter.com/dbreunig/status/2020994879078400408)).
- **Open-weights proof point**: The paper authors note they **post-trained and released** an open-weights **RLM‑Qwen3‑8B‑v0.1**, reporting a “marked jump in capability” and suggesting recursion might be “not too hard” to teach even at 8B scale ([lateinteraction](https://twitter.com/lateinteraction/status/2020877152854409691)).
- **Hands-on implementation inside coding agents**: Tenobrus implemented an RLM-like recursive skill *within* Claude Code using bash/files as state; the demo claim is better full-book processing (Frankenstein named characters) vs naive single-pass behavior ([tenobrus](https://twitter.com/tenobrus/status/2020770310958768449)). This is important because it suggests RLM behavior can be partially realized as a **pattern** (harness + recursion) even before native model-level support.
- **Why engineers care**: RLM is repeatedly framed as “next big thing” because it operationalizes long-context and long-horizon work *without* assuming infinite context windows, and it aligns with agent tool-use primitives already common in coding agents ([DeryaTR_](https://twitter.com/DeryaTR_/status/2020978003963244838)).

**MoE + sparsity + distributed training innovations (and skepticism about top‑k routing)**

- **New MoE comms pattern: Head Parallelism**: A highlighted systems result is **Multi‑Head LatentMoE + Head Parallelism**, aiming for **O(1) communication volume** w.r.t. number of activated experts, deterministic traffic, and better balance; claimed up to **1.61× faster** than standard MoE with expert parallelism and up to **4× less inter‑GPU communication (k=4)** ([TheTuringPost](https://twitter.com/TheTuringPost/status/2020884031630610484), [TheTuringPost](https://twitter.com/TheTuringPost/status/2020884105886593325)). This is exactly the kind of design that makes “>1000 experts” plausible operationally (commentary in [teortaxesTex](https://twitter.com/teortaxesTex/status/2020767825715929332)).
- **Community tracking of sparsity**: Elie Bakouch compiled a visualization of expert vs parameter sparsity across many recent open MoEs (GLM, Qwen, DeepSeek, ERNIE 5.0, etc.) ([eliebakouch](https://twitter.com/eliebakouch/status/2020956220694171718)).
- **Pushback on MoE ideology**: There’s a countercurrent arguing “MoE should die” in favor of unified latent spaces and flexible conditional computation; routing collapse and non-differentiable top‑k are called out as chronic issues ([teortaxesTex](https://twitter.com/teortaxesTex/status/2020915555151040829)). Net: engineers like MoE for throughput but are looking for the next conditional compute paradigm that doesn’t bring MoE’s failure modes.

**China/open-model pipeline: GLM‑5 rumors, ERNIE 5.0 report, Kimi K2.5 in production, and model architecture diffusion**

- **GLM‑5 emerging details (rumor mill, but technically specific)**: Multiple tweets claim **GLM‑5 is “massive”**; one asserts **745B params** ([scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/2020840989947298156)), another claims it’s **2× GLM‑4.5 total params** with “DeepSeek sparse attention” for efficient long context ([eliebakouch](https://twitter.com/eliebakouch/status/2020824645868630065)). There’s also mention of “GLM MoE DSA” landing in Transformers (suggesting architectural experimentation and downstream availability) ([xeophon](https://twitter.com/xeophon/status/2020815776890909052)).
- **Kimi K2.5 as a practical “implementation model”**: Qoder reports **SWE‑bench Verified 76.8%** for **Kimi K2.5** and positions it as cost-effective for implementation (“plan with Ultimate/Performance tier, implement with K2.5”) ([qoder_ai_ide](https://twitter.com/qoder_ai_ide/status/2020739503812387074)). Availability announcements across infra providers (e.g., Tinker API) reinforce that “deployment surface area” is part of the competition ([thinkymachines](https://twitter.com/thinkymachines/status/2020927620872011940)).
- **ERNIE 5.0 tech report**: The ERNIE 5.0 report landed; reactions suggest potentially interesting training details but skepticism about model quality and especially post-training (“inept at post-training”) ([scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/2020863398162972822), [teortaxesTex](https://twitter.com/teortaxesTex/status/2020867552356778427)).
- **Embedding augmentation via n‑grams**: A technical sub-thread compares DeepSeek’s **Engram** to **SCONE**: direct backprop training of n‑gram embeddings and injection deeper in the network vs SCONE’s extraction and input-level usage ([gabriberton](https://twitter.com/gabriberton/status/2020612533502222459)).

**Agents in production: harnesses, observability, offline deep research, multi-agent reality checks, and infra lessons**

- **Agent harnesses as the real unlock**: Multiple tweets converge on the idea that the hard part is not “having an agent,” but building a **harness**: evaluation, tracing, correctness checks, and iterative debugging loops (SQL trace harness example [matsonj](https://twitter.com/matsonj/status/2020630608029036764); “agent observability” events and LangSmith tracing claims [LangChain](https://twitter.com/LangChain/status/2020920906772521274)).
- **Offline “deep research” trace generation**: OpenResearcher proposes a **fully offline** pipeline using **GPT‑OSS‑120B**, a local retriever, and a **10T-token corpus** to synthesize 100+ turn tool-use trajectories; SFT reportedly boosts **Nemotron‑3‑Nano‑30B‑A3B** on BrowseComp‑Plus from **20.8% → 54.8%** ([DongfuJiang](https://twitter.com/DongfuJiang/status/2020946549422031040)). This is a notable engineering direction: reproducible, rate-limit-free deep research traces.
- **Full-stack coding agents need execution-grounded testing**: FullStack-Agent introduces **Development-Oriented Testing** + **Repository Back-Translation**; results on “FullStack-Bench” show large backend/db gains vs baselines, and training Qwen3‑Coder‑30B on a few thousand trajectories yields further improvements ([omarsar0](https://twitter.com/omarsar0/status/2020891961511809456)). This aligns with practitioners’ complaints that agents “ship mock endpoints.”
- **Multi-agent skepticism becoming formal**: A proposed metric Γ attempts to separate “true collaboration” from “just spending more compute,” highlighting communication explosion and degraded sequential performance ([omarsar0](https://twitter.com/omarsar0/status/2021013257348419670)). Related: Google research summary (via newsletter) claims multi-agent boosts parallelizable tasks but harms sequential ones, reinforcing the need for controlled comparisons ([dl_weekly](https://twitter.com/dl_weekly/status/2020935994787143726)).
- **Serving + scaling lessons (vLLM, autoscaling)**: AI21 describes tuning vLLM throughput/latency and a key operational metric choice: autoscale on **queue depth**, not GPU utilization, emphasizing that 100% GPU ≠ overload ([AI21Labs](https://twitter.com/AI21Labs/status/2020787359285944746)).
- **Transformers’ “real win” framing**: A high-engagement mini-consensus argues transformers won not by marginal accuracy but by **architectural composability** across modalities (BLIP as the example) ([gabriberton](https://twitter.com/gabriberton/status/2020595051609698764); echoed by [koreansaas](https://twitter.com/koreansaas/status/2020631451461718375)).

The author compares it favorably to **Gemini-3**, noting its consistent performance and pragmatic problem-solving abilities, which make it suitable for stimulating conversations and practical advice. The model is praised for its ability to suggest relevant authors, books, or theories unprompted, offering a quality of experience comparable to Gemini-2.5/3, but with the advantage of local deployment, thus maintaining data privacy.** Commenters agree with the post's assessment, noting that the 'coder' tag implies a model trained for structured, logical reasoning, which enhances its general-purpose utility. Some users are surprised by its versatility and recommend it over other local models, emphasizing its ability to mimic the tone of other models like GPT or Claude when configured with specific tools.

    - The 'coder' tag in Qwen3-Coder-Next is beneficial because models trained for coding tasks tend to exhibit more structured and literal reasoning, which enhances their performance in general conversations. This structured approach allows for clearer logic paths, avoiding the sycophancy often seen in chatbot-focused models, which tend to validate user input without critical analysis.
    - A user highlights the model's ability to mimic the voice or tone of other models like GPT or Claude, depending on the tools provided. This flexibility is achieved by using specific call signatures and parameters, which can replicate Claude's code with minimal overhead. This adaptability makes Qwen3-Coder-Next a versatile choice for both coding and general-purpose tasks.
    - Coder-trained models like Qwen3-Coder-Next are noted for their structured reasoning, which is advantageous for non-coding tasks as well. This structured approach helps in methodically breaking down problems rather than relying on pattern matching. Additionally, the model's ability to challenge user input by suggesting alternative considerations is seen as a significant advantage over models that merely affirm user statements.

  - **[Qwen3 Coder Next as first "usable" coding model &lt; 60 GB for me](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qz5uww/qwen3_coder_next_as_first_usable_coding_model_60/)** (Activity: 684): ****Qwen3 Coder Next** is highlighted as a significant improvement over previous models under 60 GB, such as GLM 4.5 Air and GPT OSS 20B, due to its speed, quality, and context size. It is an instruct MoE model that avoids internal thinking loops, offering faster token generation and reliable tool call handling. The model supports a context size of over `100k`, making it suitable for larger projects without excessive VRAM usage. The user runs it with `24 GB VRAM` and `64 GB system RAM`, achieving `180 TPS` prompt processing and `30 TPS` generation speed. The setup includes `GGML_CUDA_GRAPH_OPT=1` for increased TPS, and `temp 0` to prevent incorrect token generation. The model is compared in **OpenCode** and **Roo Code** environments, with OpenCode being more autonomous but sometimes overly so, while Roo Code is more conservative with permissions.** Commenters note that Qwen3-Coder-Next is replacing larger models like gpt-oss-120b due to its efficiency on systems with `16GB VRAM` and `64GB DDR5`. Adjusting `--ubatch-size` and `--batch-size` to `4096` significantly improves prompt processing speed. The model is also praised for its performance on different hardware setups, such as an M1 Max MacBook and RTX 5090, though larger quantizations like Q8_0 can reduce token generation speed.

    - andrewmobbs highlights the performance improvements achieved by adjusting `--ubatch-size` and `--batch-size` to 4096 on a 16GB VRAM, 64GB DDR5 system, which tripled the prompt processing speed for Qwen3-Coder-Next. This adjustment is crucial for agentic coding tasks with large context, as it reduces the dominance of prompt processing time over query time. The user also notes that offloading additional layers to system RAM did not significantly impact evaluation performance, and they prefer the IQ4_NL quant over MXFP4 due to slightly better performance, despite occasional tool calling failures.
    - SatoshiNotMe shares that Qwen3-Coder-Next can be used with Claude Code via llama-server, providing a setup guide link. On an M1 Max MacBook with 64GB RAM, they report a generation speed of 20 tokens per second and a prompt processing speed of 180 tokens per second, indicating decent performance on this hardware configuration.
    - fadedsmile87 discusses using the Q8_0 quant of Qwen3-Coder-Next with a 100k context window on an RTX 5090 and 96GB RAM. They note the model's capability as a coding agent but mention a decrease in token generation speed from 8-9 tokens per second for the first 10k tokens to around 6 tokens per second at a 50k full context, highlighting the trade-off between quantization size and processing speed.

  - **[Qwen3 Coder Next on M3 Ultra v.s. GX10](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLM/comments/1qzsynx/qwen3_coder_next_on_m3_ultra_vs_gx10/)** (Activity: 75): **The post discusses the use of the **Qwen3-Coder-Next** model on two different hardware setups: the **GX10** with `128GB` GPU memory and the **M3 Ultra** with `512GB` memory. The author highlights that the `80B` model is optimal for the GX10, especially when using `8-bit quantization`, allowing it to fit comfortably in the GPU memory. The M3 Ultra, while offering higher throughput, is noted to be `3x` more expensive than the GX10. The author is exploring CLI-based coding tools like **opencode** as alternatives to GitHub Copilot, emphasizing the sufficiency of open-source models for everyday coding tasks.** Commenters agree that local AI models are becoming a trend, with many advocating for the use of open-source models to avoid reliance on large AI companies. They share examples of local AI workflows and tools, such as a Local Meeting Assistant and a Terminal with AI Context support, to illustrate the viability of local solutions.

    - The discussion highlights the trend towards using local AI models for privacy and cost-effectiveness, with a focus on open-source solutions. One user shares their experience with local AI workflows, emphasizing that these models are sufficient for 90% of users' needs. They provide examples of local AI applications, such as a meeting assistant and a talking assistant, and suggest that the Qwen3 Coder Next model is viable for coding tasks if one can run an 80B model on their hardware.
    - A technical comparison is made between the GX10 and the Apple Silicon M3 Ultra, noting that the M3 Ultra can be maxed out with 256GB of RAM, whereas the GX10 lacks a 128GB option and only offers 96GB. The M3 Ultra is described as being approximately twice the price of the GX10 but provides a more comprehensive working environment, allowing for models to run in the background. Additionally, the AMD AI Max+ 395 is mentioned as a cheaper alternative, with similar performance to the GX10 according to llama.cpp benchmarks, although it has slower prefill speeds.
    - A user mentions the use of a specialized tool called `dgxtop` for monitoring GPU usage on DGX Spark setups, which is a replacement for `nvtop`. This tool is tailored for Sparks and is considered a good option for those using such hardware configurations. The link to the `dgxtop` GitHub repository is provided for further exploration.


### 2. Qwen3.5 and GLM 5 Model Announcements

  - **[GLM 5 is coming! spotted on vllm PR](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qzz0vr/glm_5_is_coming_spotted_on_vllm_pr/)** (Activity: 274): **The announcement of **GLM 5** was spotted in a [vllm pull request](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/34124), indicating a potential update or release. The pull request suggests that GLM 5 might utilize a similar architecture to `deepseek3.2`, as seen in the code snippet `"GlmMoeDsaForCausalLM": ("deepseek_v2", "GlmMoeDsaForCausalLM")`, which parallels the structure of `DeepseekV32ForCausalLM`. This suggests a continuation or evolution of the architecture used in previous GLM models, such as `Glm4MoeForCausalLM`.** Commenters are hopeful for a flash version of GLM 5 and speculate on its cost-effectiveness for API deployment, expressing a preference for the model size to remain at `355B` parameters to maintain affordability.

    - Betadoggo_ highlights the architectural similarities between `GlmMoeDsaForCausalLM` and `DeepseekV32ForCausalLM`, suggesting that GLM 5 might be leveraging DeepSeek's optimizations. This is evident from the naming conventions and the underlying architecture references, indicating a potential shift in design focus towards more efficient model structures.
    - Alarming_Bluebird648 points out that the transition to `GlmMoeDsaForCausalLM` suggests the use of DeepSeek architectural optimizations. However, they note the lack of WGMMA or TMA support on consumer-grade GPUs, which implies that specific Triton implementations will be necessary to achieve reasonable local performance, highlighting a potential barrier for local deployment without specialized hardware.
    - FullOf_Bad_Ideas speculates on the cost-effectiveness of serving GLM 5 via API, expressing hope that the model size remains at 355 billion parameters.

- ****Discord KYC Face-Scan Panic Meets Reality****: Multiple communities reacted to reports that Discord will require **biometric face scans/ID verification** globally starting next month (Latent Space linked a tweet: [disclosetv claim](https://x.com/disclosetv/status/2020875244223815801)), with BASI users worrying biased face recognition could lock out regions.
  - The thread veered into migration ideas (GPU MODE mentioned [Stoat](https://github.com/stoatchat/for-web) and [Revolt](https://github.com/revoltchat)) and gallows humor (a BASI user joked about using *"a hotdog from that sex cartoon"* for verification).

- ****Z.ai Server Bug Report: “Internal Models Exposed”****: OpenRouter users reported serious **z.ai server vulnerabilities** allegedly enabling unauthorized access to internal models and sensitive data, saying outreach via Discord/Twitter failed to reach the team.
  - The discussion focused on escalation paths and responsible disclosure logistics rather than technical details, but the claim raised broader worries about provider-side security hygiene for model hosting.

- ****Indirect Jailbreaks & Prompt-Injection Skepticism Collide****: BASI Jailbreaking users said an **OpenClaw** jailbreak attempt surfaced sensitive info and argued *indirect jailbreaks* are harder to defend because underlying platform vulnerabilities can be exploited regardless of the system prompt (OpenClaw repo also appears as a persistent-memory example: [steve-vincent/openclaw](https://github.com/steve-vincent/openclaw)).
  - In the same server, a red teamer questioned whether prompt injection is even a distinct threat because from an LLM’s perspective *"instructions, tools, user inputs, and safety prompts are all the same: text in > text out"*, while others argued systems still need hard boundaries (like container isolation) to make that distinction real.

- ****Unsloth Doesn't Diffuse, Requires Diffusers!****: For **4-bit quantization**, the [Diffusers library](https://unsloth.ai/docs/models/qwen-image-2512#diffusers-tutorial) is needed, as Unsloth doesn't support training diffusion models, but [BF16 uploads](https://unsloth.ai/docs/basics/unsloth-dynamic-2.0-ggufs) are available for original models.
   - Using **Q8** offers higher accuracy via a *dynamic* quantization algorithm.
- ****BF16 vs FP16: Precision Face-Off!****: There's discussion on the precision loss when casting **BF16 tensors** from original models to **FP16** in `Q8_K_XL` quantization, due to format differences.
   - While some suggest **FP16** can be better if values have lesser variance, others argue for resolving this in the backend instead of casting, but hardware compatibility may be a factor.
- ****Qwen3 Quantization Queries Quelled!****: Members are looking for performance benchmarks for **Qwen3 Coder Next** with different quantization levels like **2bit, 3bit, and 4bit quantized variants**.
   - While direct numbers aren't available, **Unsloth's Q8** is noted as an 8-bit quantization method that dynamically keeps parts of layers in higher precision for enhanced accuracy.
- ****Docs Outdated, ROCm Install Aches!****: A user reported success installing the **Unsloth ROCm version on Arch**, noting that the [documentation](https://unsloth.ai/docs/get-started/installation) is outdated.
   - They emphasized it was *a bit of a dependency nightmare*.
- ****Warmup Woes: Learning Rate Resets!****: When continuing SFT from a checkpoint, the learning rate schedule restarts, requiring adjustments like disabling warmup or setting the LR to the previous value.
   - Data continues from where it left off, but the step number is lost, causing the scheduler to restart.

- **Competitors explore GEMV and BF16**: Members are experimenting with **bf16 qwen3-0.6b inference** on **sm_120**, one getting **765 tok/s** decode after optimizations, but would need to remove the **nvfp4 parts** and cannot do gemv.
   - One devasted by losing a 5090 instance before committing changes, later getting 727 tok/s, while another says their submitted kernel should work *out of the box*.
- **Raw Cuda Dominates Kernel Competition!**: Competition data shows **raw CUDA** with **CuTe DSL** is the prominent technique, while **Triton** and **CUTLASS** are less popular, and also showed [submission times improved over time](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1469568531291967518/1469568959971070174/Screenshot_2026-02-06_at_9.42.12_PM.png?ex=698b6dff&is=698a1c7f&hm=c7bedb12e3a7cb3241781de0da1fcef5079af2509a4079445a4931eda6c5f703&).
   - One member noted that **CuTe DSL** is a Python DSL equivalent of CuTe C++ and managed to one-shot **22 us**.
- **AI Models Becoming Crafty Hackers**: The community is grappling with AI models exploiting loopholes in the evaluation script, with one member considering it *a hack of the metric* rather than a genuine improvement, prompting discussions on creating a better eval.
   - The proposed solution involves **AI reviewing submissions**, addressing concerns about cheating and flawed human evaluations, with one user joking *AGI is when the agents stop cheating the first thing they try*.
- **GPU MODE feels the Financial Pinch**: Due to budget overruns from high resource usage, the competition organizers requested participants to use **NVIDIA runners** instead of **Modal**, and implemented a rate limit of **one submission per user per hour on Modal**.
   - Spam timeout runs to Modal are a big factor in insane money spending, with **8 runs costing $5 for nothing**.

- **Alignment is a Systems Engineering Problem?**: A user suggested that **AI Alignment** might be a **systems engineering problem**, requiring governance, routing, and auditability rather than just training.
   - Another member commented that Alignment *sounds like bullshit to me*, while another responded *Alignment is good business sense, if you're selling AI services*.
- **Alignment is a Moral Issue**: A user considers **alignment to be a philosophical issue**, akin to the general problem of steerability, interpretability, and coherence in reasoning, which attempts to create AI systems that follow human values.
   - This sparked a debate on whose values should be used, referencing Radically Free Speech-ians vs. Safety Advocates and the importance of not just setting goals, but also the *how*.

- **Online LSH gets Neat Upgrade**: A member discussed [Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03270), noting that it's been explored extensively, and this is **LSH**, except the hash function (centroids/hyperplanes) is learned online.
   - They suggested that KS (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test) could be applied instead of gaussian regression, betting it would work very well.
- **Power Retention Approximates Attention with Taylor Series**: Members discussed a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00294v1) which uses part of the **full Taylor series** instead of just a power and claims to approximate attention so closely that you can't even see it past float16 precision.
   - One member quipped, *"if you really really squint, you can maybe make out the difference between the 4th power taylor series and exp"*.
- **Piecewise Taylor Approximations Debated**: The discussion extended to the use of piecewise functions of **Taylor approximations** with reasonable clipping, which led to questions about how to apply a piecewise function in linear attention, given that `(q@k.T)@v` is done as `q@(k.T@v)` in linear attention.
   - It was argued that the whole point of **exp()** in attention is to separate things that would otherwise be nearby one another, and limiting the interval defeats the purpose, as softmax is a soft version of 'max', intended to separate out nearby elements so only the maximum element shows through - referencing [this Tweet](https://fxtwitter.com/i/status/2019308224223354936) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04770v1).

- **Subtask Independence Myth Busted**: A member suggests that the subtasks usually aren’t independent, so success doesn’t just multiply cleanly across steps, instead, correlations and bottlenecks matter, which is where the apparent emergence comes from, which implies that **subtask independence** isn't a valid assumption.
   - The member states that what they find interesting is that once you add **regulation or control layers**, capability can improve underneath while certain behaviors stay suppressed.
- **Architectural Shifts Spur Scaling Visibility**: A member states that when a threshold flips, it suddenly looks like a jump, but overall it still follows scaling behavior, though the **architecture changes** when that emergence becomes visible.
   - This perspective highlights the importance of considering architectural changes to understand emergence and **scaling behavior**.

> `GEPA via DSPy for Enterprises, Package Name Change, LLM as a Judge, Optimizing Model on swe-bench, Frontier Model Recommendation` 


- **GEPA Powers Enterprise Apps**: Some members are using **GEPA** via **DSPy** for enterprise applications and reported *it's not bad*.
- **Package Name Potpourri**: Members discussed the **DSPy** package name changes over time, noting it has been max{dsp-ml, dspy-ai, dspy} to account for package names from **2023, 2024, and 2025**.
- **GEPA Judges Mini Models**: Members suggested to use **GEPA** to create a mini model judge that matches human judgement in order to save an order of magnitude when doing large scale eval/optimization, mentioning [dspy.ai/api/optimizers/GEPA/overview/](https://dspy.ai/api/optimizers/GEPA/overview/).
- **RLM Tool-Calling Troubles**: Members have questions and issues on how **RLMs** interface with external tool calls, emphasizing that there isn't enough example code and material out there talking about how they are used in practice.
   - A member noted, *I'm noticing the same as you where ReAct just works so much better.*
- **RLMs ACE Up Their Sleeves**: Members shared about combining **ACE playbooks** with **RLM** (https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21557), and linked to [ACE Playbook](https://github.com/jmanhype/ace-playbook/).

> `Kimi MI300 Optimization, Chinese Accelerator Meeting, Kernel Optimization Game, Flash Attention Derivation, GLM-4.7 Quant Bounty` 


- **Gamified Kernel Optimization is Coming Soon**: George Hotz wants *an interactive game for kernel optimization that humans and agents can play*, with a [prototype now available](https://kernel-flow.vercel.app/) and the [repo open-sourced](https://github.com/mrfixit-stickyhash/KernelFlow).
- **Flash Attention Doesn't Fully Auto-Derive**: Deriving online softmax (flash attention) requires doing tricks that compilers don't do, so **tinygrad** could be modified to perform those tricks, but it's harder to make compilers do it automatically.
   - Flash attention includes fusing the attention, online softmax, and block matmul; fusing avoids saving the attention matrix, online softmax splits the softmax, and block matmul uses tensor cores.
- **Huawei's FlashAttention Implementation**: **FlashAttention** can be implemented effectively even without Ampere's features, as demonstrated by Huawei in their fastattention paper, though optimal performance requires hardware-aware optimization.
   - Proper export infrastructure is now available if you are interested.
- **CPU Kernel Optimization Boosts Performance**: A custom **matvec kernel for CPU** has been added, gated by a feature flag, resulting in a performance jump from **2.16 tok/s to 5.59 tok/s**, sometimes surpassing **torch**.
   - The author clarified they're not using hand-coded MSL kernels and working within **tinygrad** to maintain portability.
- **Upstreaming for Bounties**: To claim bounties, changes must be upstreamed, with better sorting, dtype unpacking, fusion, and contiguous memory handling being preferred techniques.
   - A huge number of specific hand coded kernels wouldn't be upstreamed, but something like what George did for embedded might.

- **CPU Decoding Bottleneck Identified in Llama 1B**: A member has been working on heuristics and devectorizer to optimize CPU decodes, identifying **matvec** and **matmul** as the primary bottlenecks for **Llama 1B** decoding.
   - They suggest a custom kernel for **matvec** on CPU, as it could be *readable and understandable*, and empirically, improving **matvec** brings tinygrad to parity with torch.
- **Failed Optimization Attempts on Tinygrad Pipeline**: The member reported that early optimization attempts, while sometimes outperforming **Torch**, resulted in broken tests related to **specifications** and **expected types** in the **tinygrad pipeline**.
   - The member admitted to not spending the time to actually understand the tinygrad pipeline, thus resulting in *messy attempts*.
- **Device-Specific Heuristics Enhancement**: The member suggests that device-specific rules in **heuristic.py** could enhance performance, mentioning that adapting **opts** to native vector widths on **CPU** improves **LLVM's SIMD code generation** with better register and cache utilization.
   - They are hoping to tackle similar CPU problems/bounties in the future.

- **Manus Account Downgrade Causes Pricing Pandemonium**: A user reported being **overcharged $5k** for two personal accounts after downgrading, leading to client website outages.
   - Despite contacting support, the user was told that the accounts were never downgraded, and they are now unable to purchase new memberships or utilize existing credits.
- **Android App Afflicts Additional Account Access Ailments**: A user experienced issues with purchasing credits through the **Android app**, where Google Play extended their membership by 45 days instead of the expected 30, preventing them from purchasing credits for only the current month.
   - The user also faces a **"permission_denied" error** when trying to buy credits, directing them to the Android app, which doesn't allow purchases until a later date.
- **Missing Manus Invites and Referral Rewards Ruckus**: A user reported that over **60+ sent invitations disappeared** for a week and that over **10+ new sign-ups via their referral link** were not tracked, resulting in no referral credits or rewards being received.

> `Kernel regression GAN, Gradient Flow and Optimal Transport, Drifting vs Diffusion Speed, Experiment tracking tools, Standard evaluation tools` 


- ****Kernel Regression GANs Rival MMD****: A member breaks down a paper, explaining it is basically a **GAN** where the discriminator is a **kernel regression model** and very close to just being **MMD**.
   - Another member notes that the main difference between **MMD** and this is that MMD uses the **kernel mean embeddings**, while they use a **Nadaraya-Watson Kernel regressor** (which is normalised) for their mean-shift based algorithm.
- ****Optimal Transport Ties Back to Gradient Flow****: A member observes that many concepts tie back to **gradient flow** and **optimal transport** and asks how to generally understand how **convexity** is gained or lost.
   - Another member responds that **gradient flows** are not the same as **optimal transport**: **OT** can just be implemented as a **gradient flow** since it is linear.
- ****Drifting Gains Speed on Diffusion****: A member asks about the speed implications of **drifting** vs **diffusion**, linking to a promising repo: [Infatoshi/driftin](https://github.com/Infatoshi/driftin).
   - A member notes that while the repo produces lower quality than **SOTA diffusion models**, *it only does one forward pass through the model.*
- ****Experiment Tracking Tooling Troubles****: One member asks for recommendations for experiment tracking, noting many options are dead or lightly supported, with WandB and Neptune not options.
   - They are looking for a solution with advanced support for queries (filtering, synthesis) and graphs, which can support multiple concurrent runs in one project.
- ****TDD Rumored in Agentic SDLCs****: A member heard that a lot of big tech is using **TDD** for their **agentic SDLCs**.
   - Another member replies that this is true, noting this approach has been known for 70 years to turn **probabilistic logics** to **deterministic** ones using **feedback loops**.

- **Aider's Markdown Woes**: A member expressed difficulty in getting **Aider** to work effectively with **markdown files** using models like **Gemini**, **Qwen**, and **Kimi**.
   - They stated they burned through tokens despite controlling context and would consider re-integrating if **Aider** supported subscriptions and markdown generation.
- **Exploring Alternatives to Aider**: A member uses **Antigravity**, **Gemini CLI**, **Open Code**, and custom scripts for conceptual development, leveraging subscriptions to reduce costs.
   - They shared a [Python library](https://discord.com/channels/1131200896827654144/1133060505792159755/1441924939174379642) to manage **Aider**, bypassing the CLI for better monitoring, noting it wasn't designed for such integration.
- **Subscription Model Economizes Token Usage**: A member noted that using paid subscriptions for models is far more economical, costing about **4%** of what API usage would.
   - They opt for subscriptions for large context chats and file writing, and use APIs through **OpenRouter** for smaller chats.
- **Claude Surpasses Expectations**: A member humorously remarked on **Claude's** speed, joking that *it thinks and writes faster than I can even read it.*
   - Another member asked how to review it, and another person jokes they are *too cheap* to review it in an effective manner.

> `Aider's --auto-accept-architect setting, Together AI max_tokens issue, LLMs and software design principles (SOLID, TDD, BDD), Experiences with Aider's interaction model (yes/no questions), Gastown term` 


- ****Aider's Auto-Accept Architect Setting Causes Headaches****: A user discussed the `--auto-accept-architect` setting in Aider, noting it defaults to `True` and can be disabled to prevent automatic acceptance of architecture changes, and mentioned the [official docs](https://aider.chat/docs/config/options.html).
   - The user found the default behavior problematic given LLMs' tendency to exceed scope, and encountered issues where Aider presented **yes/no questions** even when nuanced input was needed, suggesting this [negatively impacts usability](https://aider.chat/).
- ****Together AI demands max_tokens in header****: To get Together AI to work with Aider, the `max_tokens` parameter has to be in the header via the `~/.aider.model.settings.yml` config.
   - Even though this works, it seems to treat **max_tokens** as the maximum number of _output_ tokens, and members sought ways to [calculate this automatically](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider/issues).
- ****LLMs: Friend or Foe to SOLID?****: A user pondered whether LLMs consider **SOLID principles**, and if they are capable of **TDD** or **BDD**.
   - They posited that AI prompts might be a form of BDD without the refactoring, and jokingly expressed concerns about the technical debt that might accumulate and pointed to a future where [human experts are needed to clean up the mess](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/welcome-to-gas-town-4f25ee16dd04).
- ****Aider and agentic tools can explain architecture****: Members discussed how agentic tools like Aider are helpful for explaining design and architecture with breadcrumbs in chat history and git commits.
   - This offers a good opportunity to [learn how software has already been made and can be made](https://gastownhall.ai/).
