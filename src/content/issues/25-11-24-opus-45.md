The SWE-Bench Verified progression is so steady it's hard to chalk up to pure coincidence:

- Nov 18: Gemini 3 Pro claims 76.2% (SOTA)
- Nov 19: GPT-5.1-Codex-Max (xhigh) claims 77.9% (new SOTA)
- Nov 24 (today): [Opus 4.5 claims 80.9%](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5) (new SOTA) - with a new effort param on 'high'

[A bar graph comparing the accuracy of various AI models on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark, with Opus 4.5 leading](https://resend-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/uVMAsRebrNiEb1K)

And yet here we are. Of course, this isn't just benchmaxxing, as the improvements are indeed broad based, including a new SOTA claim on ARC-AGI-2:

[Comparison of AI model performance across various benchmarks, highlighting Opus 4.5's strong results in areas like agentic coding, tool](https://resend-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/mpRbQd2EQhf45rA)

Extra API additions: [effort control](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort), [context compaction](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-editing#client-side-compaction-sdk), and [advanced tool use](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/advanced-tool-use).

And Claude Code is now [bundled with Claude Desktop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrcCS9oHjtI&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anthropic.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anthropic.com), with [Claude for Chrome](https://claude.ai/redirect/website.v1.3a8af620-b1e8-4cbc-bdac-0c37b81e5891/chrome) and [Claude for Excel](https://www.claude.com/claude-for-excel) rolling out to even more users.

The most notable thing for many is the pricing - with a 3x price cut compared to Opus 4.1, Opus 4.5 is suddenly very viable as a workhorse model, especially given its [improved token efficiency vs Sonnet 4.5](https://twitter.com/alexalbert__/status/1993030687881080944). Usage limits also got improvements - you have roughly the same Opus token limits as Sonnet limits.

- **Fine‑Tuning Pitfalls: Chat Templates, SFT Collapse & Qwen3 Formats**: In **Unsloth**, multiple users hit classic fine‑tuning landmines: full SFT over an instruct model causing **repetition after ~1500 tokens**, `load_in_4bit=True` merges creating rogue local `.cache` directories instead of using the standard **Hugging Face cache**, and **Llama 3.2‑vision GRPO** runs failing on unsupported `aspect_ratio_ids` in **vLLM** ([Unsloth VLM RL docs](https://docs.unsloth.ai/new/vision-reinforcement-learning-vlm-rl)).
    - Mentors repeatedly stress that you must use the **exact same chat template at inference as used during training** – symptoms like the model answering *“Let me know when you’re ready for an instruction”* usually indicate template/tokenizer mismatches – and Qwen3 users are pointed to TRL’s `formatting_func` [docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/en/sft_trainer#trl.SFTTrainer.formatting_func) after hitting key‑name and ChatML‑format bugs, reinforcing that data+template discipline is as important as optimizer choice.
- **Novel Architectures and Learning Rules: Nested Learning, Muon, FAST & Ring RNNs**: On **Nous**, contributors explore **Nested Learning** architectures with fast/medium/slow loops (attention, writable memory matrix, and weights), arguing that GPUs are ill‑matched to sequential slow loops (*“GPU launch overhead is brutal compared to a CPU”*) and predicting that **AMD Strix Halo**‑style unified CPU+GPU memory could change that dynamic, while **Eleuther scaling‑laws** discussions compare four **Muon** optimizer variants ([KellerJordan’s](https://github.com/KellerJordan/Muon/blob/master/muon.py) [muon.py](http://muon.py/) and [this survey](https://main-horse.github.io/translations/kexue/11416/#four-versions)).
    - In **GPU MODE robotics‑vla**, the new [**FAST (Frequency‑space Action Sequence Tokenizer)** paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09747) swaps RVQ for **DCT‑based action tokens with BPE‑compressed 1024‑token vocab and interleaved coefficients**, and engineers fine‑tune **Qwen3‑VL** on the **RoboTwin HDF5 dataset** (hitting disk‑full at 5k steps but promising initial loss curves), while **Hugging Face**’s `today‑im-learning` thread digs into **Ring RNNs as ring attractors** ([ring‑attractor paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/network-physiology/articles/10.3389/fnetp.2025.1693772/full)) and **equilibrium propagation for lifelong learning** ([Equilibrium Propagation paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14081)), showing strong interest in alternatives to plain transformers+backprop.

> `Chat Templates and Inference, Unsloth Caching Issue with 16bit Models, GRPO Training Issues with Llama 3.2-vision, RL Training with OSS-20B, Qwen3 finetuning formatting function issue` 


- **Chat Template Cruciality for Inference**: Using the **exact same chat template** for inference as used during training is crucial to avoid incoherent model responses, and that issues often stem from incorrect chat template usage or tokenizer configurations.
   - One member stated that the model replying with variations of *"Let me know when you're ready for an instruction"* indicates a potential template issue.
- **Unsloth's Peculiar Caching during Merging**: A user reported that when loading a model with `load_in_4bit = True`, Unsloth downloads the **4-bit model automatically**; however, merging with `model.save_pretrained_merged` creates a `.cache` folder within the output folder instead of using the **Huggingface cache**.
   - A team member acknowledged this as an issue and is planning a fix to either delete the `.cache` folder completely or download directly into the **HF cache**.
- **Llama 3.2-vision GRPO training gives error**: A user encountered errors training **Llama 3.2-vision** with GRPO related to `aspect_ratio_ids` and backward graph issues, so they were encouraged to not double post on multiple channels.
   - A team member pointed to the [Unsloth documentation](https://docs.unsloth.ai/new/vision-reinforcement-learning-vlm-rl) saying that fast inference for **VLMs** is not supported in **vLLM** for Llama 3.2 Vision.
- **OSS-20B RL Training Almost Within Reach**: A user attempted to train **OSS-20B** with RL using the ART notebooks, upgrading transformers, torch, and Unsloth, and compiling vLLM from source to resolve import errors.
   - After a 45-minute compilation, they aimed to migrate the bindings of ART, highlighting the model's potential for code-related tasks (codeforces > 2000).
- **Qwen3 users face Formatting Function Frustrations**: Users expressed confusion in formatting functions for **Qwen3**, even when using chatML format, while others struggled with the key names being wrong or undefined errors.
   - Members were pointed to the [TRL documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/en/sft_trainer#trl.SFTTrainer.formatting_func), as well as advised to minimize code modifications early on and create reproducible examples for assistance.

- **NanoChat Pipeline Dreams of TinyStories**: Despite concerns, one member believes that the current model is a publishable starting point for something like the **NanoChat** pipeline, showing the *barebones minimum in capacity to model language* with **tinystories**.
   - The goal is to make pretraining *useful* models at home easier or on affordable rented plans, to lower the *barrier to entry*.
- **Battling Burnout with Breaks**: One member shared that they need to take breaks to recharge, as ADHD + burnout is difficult to deal with, and pushing too far can lead to dropping projects for months.
   - Mental exertion also triggers migraines, creating a negative conditioning effect that makes it harder to return to the project.
- **Brains Beat Brute Force**: A member argues that *the way forward can’t stay “just brute force things with more compute” forever*, emphasizing that natural brains are not monolithic designs but have different sections optimized for different tasks.
   - Conventional transformers, being monolithic, attempt to brute force their way to handle all functions at once.
- **Smaller Models, Better Training?**: Despite partial agreement that monolithic designs can work for simple tasks, a member notes that for complex tasks, they are wasteful, citing **TRM's** ability to perform spatial reasoning better than trillion-parameter transformers with only 7 million parameters.
   - They believe better training methods and smaller, improved models can surpass the 50+ billion parameter trend.
- **Ternary Computing Sparks Ideas**: A member questions the potential of rewriting **Long RoPE 2** in ternary form and using ternary to quantize a model, potentially encoding more information into the fundamental data unit.
   - They hypothesized that ternary code for model training and ternary representations might increase compute but reduce model size and training time, proposing the idea of a *smaller model with the same performance at a smaller size*.

- **Llama2 Performance Improved After Heap Allocation Fix**: A user tracked down and fixed a performance degradation issue with **Llama2** after updating to the latest **Mojo compiler** by switching the **Accumulator struct** from heap to stack allocation, resulting in higher performance, detailed in [this forum post](https://forum.modular.com/t/llama2-performance-degradation-after-updating-code-to-the-latest-mojo-compiler/2465/2?u=aydyn).
   - The user identified that **35%** of execution time was spent in `Accumulator::__init__` due to heap allocations, and they plan to share a write-up on setting up profiling on Mac.
- **Sum Types May Arrive Sooner**: A user asked about the timeline for features like **sum types**, **static reflection**, **graphics programming**, and **custom operator definition** in Mojo.
   - Another user responded that **sum types** has a chance of making it into the **1.0 release**.
- **Graphics Programming's Future in Mojo**: A user inquired about the inclusion of **graphics programming** in Mojo's language or standard library, with community members suggesting it's unlikely due to the rapidly changing nature of graphics technology, but also highlighted the existence of **cool mojo graphics packages** like [shimmer](https://github.com/lsh/shimmer).
   - Some discussed the possibility of converting Mojo compute buffers into storage buffer pointers for other APIs like **Vulkan and OpenGL**, but concerns were raised about breaking API guarantees and encapsulation.
- **WebGPU Integration in Mojo**: A member suggested creating [**typegpu**](https://docs.swmansion.com/TypeGPU/) which uses **WebGPU** as the rendering API and **WGSL** functions written in **mojo/python** code.
   - The idea is to reimplement typegpu in mojo with webgpu native, with the benefit of not having to unify mojo compute kernels and mojo graphics shaders, and taking advantage of Mojo using MLIR instead of LLVM.

fn some_fn() raises -> Int:
  var some = Optional(SomeStruct(1))
  return some[].field[]
```
- **Bitwise AND has higher precedence than logical AND**: Members discussed a scenario where bitwise `and` (`&`) and logical `and` are separate operators, and bitwise has higher precedence.

- **Bitfield Wrangling Bonanza**: With the push into assemblers and the **SQTT parser**, the best way to manipulate bitfields in Python was questioned.
   - It was suggested that the **Struct** object in `support/c.py` could be enhanced and generated from C structs, potentially as a Python class, with inspiration drawn from [applegpu.py](https://github.com/dougallj/applegpu/blob/main/applegpu.py).
- **ISPC Integration Invitation**: Interest was expressed in adding an [ISPC](https://ispc.github.io/index.html) backend to tinygrad.
   - ISPC (Intel SPMD Program Compiler) is a compiler for a variant of the C programming language, with extensions for "single program, multiple data" (SPMD) programming, allowing GPU-style programming on the CPU utilizing SIMD registers.
- **tinygrad Alpha Aiming Ambitions**: A question arose about whether **Q2 2026** is still the estimated timeframe for tinygrad to exit alpha.
- **GPT-OSS's extra Scatter operation**: olmoe only works for batch size of 1, resulting in an extra scatter operation for GPT-OSS.
