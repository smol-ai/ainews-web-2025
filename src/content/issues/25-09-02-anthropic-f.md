This was widely rumored, but the final valuation came in higher. Some notable numbers from their [announcement](https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-raises-series-f-at-usd183b-post-money-valuation):

- In Jan 2025, Anthropic at about a $1B run-rate. **By August 2025, it crossed $5B** (36.6x current ARR multiple, but [20x EOY25 multiple](https://x.com/swyx/status/1951775849533038969))
- Claude Code was GA in May 2025 - **usage grew >10x in last three months** and now is **$500m in run-rate revenue** (we called this out [in June](https://news.smol.ai/issues/25-06-20-claude-code))
- Anthropic now serves over **300,000 business customers**, and our number of **large accounts**—customers that each represent over $100,000 in run-rate revenue—has **grown nearly 7x in the past year**.

Congrats Anthropic!

**Agentic systems: enterprise connectors, new evals, and reliability**

- Mistral Le Chat adds 20+ MCP connectors and “Memories.” Le Chat now plugs into Stripe, GitHub, Atlassian, Linear, Notion, Snowflake (coming soon), and more, with fine-grained access controls and persistent, user-editable memory. This turns Le Chat into a single surface for cross-SaaS action and retrieval, while remaining enterprise-manageable. See the launch thread from [@MistralAI](https://twitter.com/MistralAI/status/1962881084183527932) and Stripe’s demo by [@emilygsands](https://twitter.com/emilygsands/status/1962884010289590583).
- Benchmarking agents:
    - Artificial Analysis updated its Intelligence Index (V3) to include Terminal-Bench Hard and τ²-Bench (Telecom). GPT‑5 leads, with o3 close behind; xAI’s Grok Code Fast 1/Grok 4 and Claude/Kimi/gpt-oss families perform well on tool calling/agent tasks. Details: [@ArtificialAnlys](https://twitter.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/1962881314925023355), [follow-up 1](https://twitter.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/1962881324727087253), [2](https://twitter.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/1962881327151431773).
    - MCP‑Universe (Salesforce) evaluates agents across 231 real-world tasks using actual MCP servers (Google Maps, GitHub, Yahoo Finance, Playwright, etc.) with code-based evaluators. Top model achieves 43.7% success; performance is highly domain-specific; “more tools” can hurt.

# AI Reddit Recap

## /r/LocalLlama + /r/localLLM Recap

### 1. TerminalBench Multi-Agent Coder & German WWTBAM Benchmark

- [**My weekend project accidentally beat Claude Code - multi-agent coder now #12 on Stanford's TerminalBench 😅**](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n6epwv) ([Score: 567, Comments: 42](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1n6epwv/my_weekend_project_accidentally_beat_claude_code/)): **Open-source multi-agent coding system with an Orchestrator (no direct code I/O), Explorer (read/run-only), and Coder agents plus a persistent Context Store for shared “knowledge artifacts” reached 36.0% on [Stanford/Laude TerminalBench](https://www.tbench.ai/) with Claude Sonnet-4 (rank #12, ahead of Claude Code) and 19.25% with Qwen3-Coder-480B; Sonnet-4 used** `93.2M` **tokens vs Qwen’s** `14.7M`**. Orchestrator enforces explicit delegation, adaptive trust (high autonomy on simple tasks, iterative decomposition on complex), and per-agent toolsets; artifacts are stored and injected into subsequent subagent contexts. Full code, prompts, and configs are open-sourced: [Danau5tin/multi-agent-coding-system](https://github.com/Danau5tin/multi-agent-coding-system).** Commenters propose testing alternative fast/cheap models (e.g., grok-code-fast-1, “gpt5-mini”) and question the choice of YAML for tool calls versus more standard JSON or Qwen3-Coder’s XML schema; there’s also support for transparent, local-model-friendly open-source agentic tooling.
    - Benchmark results cited: **Orchestrator + Sonnet-4** at `36.0%` success (ranked #12 on TerminalBench, ahead of Claude Code) vs **Orchestrator + Qwen-3-Coder** at `19.25%`. Suggestions to trial **grok-code-fast-1** and **gpt5-mini** for improved latency/cost, noting they may be *"fast af and cheap compared to cc"* relative to Claude Code.
    - A technical question challenges the choice of using YAML for tool calls instead of JSON (the typical function-calling schema) or the newer XML patterns attributed to **Qwen-3-Coder**. This raises issues around parser determinism, ecosystem/tooling compatibility, and adherence to established structured I/O conventions across model providers.
    - A productionization concern asks how to move from benchmark wins to real projects while controlling inference spend, given **Sonnet** runs reportedly chewing through `90M+` tokens. The thread probes budgeting strategies and whether the multi-agent orchestration can cap tool chatter and token burn for day-to-day coding workloads.
- [**German "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" Benchmark**](https://i.redd.it/du3iq68grrmf1.png) ([Score: 411, Comments: 54](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1n6mi81/german_who_wants_to_be_a_millionaire_benchmark/)): **OP releases a German “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire” benchmark with 45 rounds × 15 questions (exit on first wrong answer per round, winnings retained, no lifelines) and posts a results table comparing mostly local, quantized (Q4_K_M) LLMs run on a Framework Laptop 13 (Ryzen 5 7640U, 32GB). The table shows gpt-oss-20b (low) leading with** `€80.177` **average winnings and** `3` **million wins, followed by models like mistral-small-3.2 and qwen3-30b-a3b-2507; parameters include temperature (T), top-k (K), top-p (P), and a min threshold. Early questions heavy on German idioms/wordplay were hardest for models but easy for humans; “thinking” modes were mostly disabled due to latency and initial tests (e.g., qwen3-4b-thinking-2507) suggesting degraded accuracy on early items. Full code/results: https://github.com/ikiruneo/millionaire-bench** Commenters probe hyperparameter tuning—especially temperature choices (e.g., T=1 vs 0.15)—ask about question sourcing, and request inclusion of non-local/hosted models for broader comparison.
    - Quant level strongly affects accuracy and varies by model family; assuming a blanket `q4` can skew rankings. Commenters suggest reporting the exact quant (e.g., `q4_K_M`, `q5_K_M`, AWQ, GPTQ) per run and, ideally, benchmarking multiple quants per model to show sensitivity. Activation-aware and outlier-aware schemes (e.g., AWQ [arXiv:2306.00978](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00978)) often retain reasoning better than naive 4-bit, while GPTQ [arXiv:2210.17323](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17323) and 4-bit NF4 via bitsandbytes [HF blog](https://huggingface.co/blog/4bit-transformers-bitsandbytes) behave differently across LLaMA-derived vs Mistral models. Including quant in the table and controlling for it would make cross-model comparisons credible.
    - Implementation feedback: the prompt asks for a single letter, but the API does not constrain generation; set a short `max_new_tokens` (e.g., 1–5), add stop tokens, or use grammar-constrained decoding (e.g., llama.cpp grammars) to force `[A-D]` only ([llama.cpp grammars](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/master/grammars/README.md), [OpenAI logit_bias](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat-create-logit_bias)). Current parsing grabs the first uppercase letter anywhere in the string, which can misread chain-of-thought or headings; instead, require a structured target like `Final: A` or `\boxed{A}` and parse with a strict regex, then log adherence metrics: exact compliance rate, guess rate, and “no answer” rate. For models emitting hidden/visible “thinking” blocks (e.g., GPT-OSS), strip those sections before extraction and verify the final answer matches the parsed token.
    - Several runs show widely varying temperatures (`1.0` vs `0.15`); commenters recommend per-model hyperparameter sweeps (temperature/top_p) and reporting both best accuracy and variance across seeds. Use 3–5 replicates per setting to estimate stability, then select the best config per model to avoid penalizing models that need low sampling noise for MCQ tasks. Also consider a 'reasoning allowance' prompt variant (e.g., answer format `\boxed{A}` with optional brief rationale) and measure whether limited reasoning improves accuracy under the same decoding budget.

### 2. ETHZ Apertus LLM Launch & MAESTRO v0.1.5

- [**New Open LLM from Switzerland "Apertus", 40%+ training data is non English**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1n6eimy/new_open_llm_from_switzerland_apertus_40_training/) ([Score: 229, Comments: 63](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1n6eimy/new_open_llm_from_switzerland_apertus_40_training/)): **ETH Zurich announced Apertus, a "fully open, transparent" multilingual LLM trained with >**`40%` **non‑English data, claiming native support for** `1,811` **languages and use of legally "compliant" sources ([press release](https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2025/09/press-release-apertus-a-fully-open-transparent-multilingual-language-model.html)). The team says they will publish tooling to reconstruct the pretraining corpus (repo: [swiss-ai/pretrain-data](https://github.com/swiss-ai/pretrain-data) — currently 404), and community members are eyeing a** `70B` **checkpoint for local use via quantized GGUF. A public demo includes a Schwiizerdütsch toggle ([chat.publicai.co](http://chat.publicai.co/)).** Top comments question potential "Swiss" regional bias after seeing Swiss-themed hallucinations in an unrelated 3D geometry Q&A, and express skepticism that `1,811` languages can be adequately supported given low-resource data scarcity. Others are optimistic about the compliance-first dataset and reproducible pretraining pipeline as a meaningful step toward truly open LLMs, pending the repo's availability.
    - Early benchmarking notes that Apertus `8B` and `70B` overall accuracy falls within the band bounded by **Llama 3.1 8B** and **Llama 3.1 70B**. This positions Apertus as competitive but not SOTA versus Meta’s latest baselines, suggesting optimization headroom in training or inference stacks.
    - A key technical promise is dataset transparency: the model card reportedly describes a method to reconstruct the pretraining corpus, implying reproducible pretraining on fully “compliant” data. However, the referenced repo `https://github.com/swiss-ai/pretrain-data` is currently `404`, so the community is awaiting concrete release artifacts to validate openness and run independent replications.
    - The claim of `1811` “natively supported” languages drew skepticism about data sufficiency for many low-resource languages (often <100k speakers). Anecdotes of weak French performance despite `40%+` non‑English pretraining hint at uneven multilingual quality, and some users are waiting on a `GGUF` quant for the `70B` to test local inference performance and multilingual behavior.

A new docs site ([docs](https://murtaza-nasir.github.io/maestro), [GitHub release](https://github.com/murtaza-nasir/maestro)) includes an [Example Reports](https://murtaza-nasir.github.io/maestro/example-reports/) gallery showcasing outputs from locally hosted models—e.g., Qwen 2.5** `72B`**, GPT‑OSS** `120B`**, Qwen 3** `32B`**, Gemma 3** `27B`**, GPT‑OSS** `20B`**—plus run notes such as KV‑cache usage to help compare model behavior on complex topics.** Commenters praise the UI and local‑model focus, and ask whether MAESTRO performs factual‑accuracy checks and verifies that cited passages actually appear in the referenced sources. Another commenter highlights a related domain‑specific research tool for equity analysis that ingests 10‑K/10‑Q filings (deepvalue.tech).
    - Several commenters ask for built‑in factuality controls: does MAESTRO run evidence‑grounded verification on generated claims and validate that each citation actually appears in the referenced source? They’re specifically interested in citation span checking (quote-level matching), and model‑agnostic approaches like NLI/entailment checks or retrieval cross‑validation to flag hallucinations and mismatched attributions.
    - Deployment and model‑routing feedback: requests for a non‑Docker distribution (e.g., simple local install) and appreciation for strong local‑model support plus an LLM‑agnostic UI where users can switch providers/models from a dropdown. One commenter notes they recently made their assistant "LLM agnostic," highlighting interest in clean abstraction layers for swapping between open/closed models without changing pipelines.
    - Adjacent use case: a finance‑focused research tool pulling SEC filings (10‑K/10‑Q) and industry publications to auto‑generate value‑investing reports, suggesting MAESTRO‑like RAG workflows for long‑document ingestion and summarization. Prototype link: https://www.deepvalue.tech/; indicates demand for domain‑specific retrieval, source tracking, and compliance‑grade citation handling in financial research.

### 1. Google "Nano Banana" rename and early user benchmarks/demos

  - **[Google is now officially calling "Gemini 2.5 Flash image preview", "Nano Banana"](https://i.redd.it/bqqv8zlziomf1.png)** ([Score: 506, Comments: 44](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1n6a7np/google_is_now_officially_calling_gemini_25_flash/)): **Google has surfaced the internal codename “Nano Banana” as the public label for its “Gemini 2.5 Flash image preview” model in the model picker UI, describing it as a state‑of‑the‑art image generation and editing model with metered input/output costs. The screenshot also lists adjacent models—Gemini 2.5 Pro, 2.5 Flash, and 2.5 Flash‑Lite—indicating “Nano Banana” is a distinct image‑gen/edit variant rather than a replacement for those text models; no new capabilities or architectural changes are disclosed beyond the renaming.** Commenters view this as a savvy marketing decision, noting Google is capitalizing on the name’s virality by surfacing the codename in the public interface.

  - **[Nano Banana passed in my benchmark](https://i.redd.it/9umm811n2qmf1.jpeg)** ([Score: 415, Comments: 97](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1n6f4fj/nano_banana_passed_in_my_benchmark/)): **OP demonstrates an AI-driven recolor/edit where a Monster Energy Ultra Gold can is turned from gold to white “in seconds” by a model they call “Nano Banana,” while maintaining scene composition (octopus prop) but introducing a telltale global hue-shift artifact: the can’s white text/logos also become yellow ([image](https://i.redd.it/9umm811n2qmf1.jpeg)). This suggests fast, context-aware editing without robust text/instance masking; OP contrasts this with preferring **Sora** for creation (implying this is an editing benchmark rather than generation).** Commenters note the incorrect text recolor and joke “Nice try, Adobe,” while another highlights the time saved versus manual Photoshop work (claiming ~1 hour), underscoring speed vs. precision trade-offs.

    - - Color spillover artifact: one comment notes the model turned white overlay text yellow, indicating the recolor/edit pass wasn’t constrained to object regions. This suggests a lack of semantic masking/instance segmentation in the pipeline—common with latent diffusion image-to-image recolor/inpaint ops without explicit masks—so global hue shifts bleed into high-contrast overlays; the provided [screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/8ic6kxbzjqmf1.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&s=3642ff0ee8ad8f1d6e91bc874edb4ff25430f1f9) illustrates the issue. Avoiding this typically requires OCR-aware text preservation or mask-guided editing rather than pure prompt-based changes.
    - Productivity trade-off vs manual workflows: a user estimates `~1 hour` in Photoshop to reproduce the effect, highlighting how automated diffusion edits can replace labor-intensive steps (precise selections, edge refinement, gradient maps/curves, and text/channel protection). The generative result arrives in seconds but sacrifices fine-grained control and artifact avoidance unless masks or control signals are supplied.
    - Safety/filtering constraints: attempts to generate "dead" cartoon images (even characters simply "laying down") are blocked by content policy, implying conservative violence/self-harm classifiers with high recall and notable false positives. This limits benign use cases (e.g., DnD assets) unless platforms expose granular policy toggles or allow non-graphic, SFW depictions under stricter review.

  - **[Used nano banana to "clean up" visuals for a document](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n6lexe)** ([Score: 878, Comments: 94](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1n6lexe/used_nano_banana_to_clean_up_visuals_for_a/)): **A user showcases using a model referred to as “nano banana” to clean up a document image—likely via AI inpainting/denoising to remove artifacts and reconstruct legible content. The linked gallery requires authentication ([reddit.com/gallery/1n6lexe](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n6lexe)), but discussion centers on the model’s ability to plausibly restore text/graphics, alongside the technical risk that such restoration can hallucinate content when signal is weak (a known issue with diffusion-based inpainting).** Commenters warn of misuse for deceptive marketplace imagery and displacement of traditional Photoshop workflows, and one requests the original/ground truth text to validate whether the model inferred content beyond what was present—highlighting concerns about reconstruction fidelity and provenance.

    - - A commenter flags fidelity risk: generative “cleanup” can hallucinate legible text that wasn’t present, reconstructing content beyond the original signal. For document workflows, this can mislead OCR/archival; prefer non-generative deblurring + OCR (e.g., Tesseract/PaddleOCR) before any diffusion/inpainting like [Adobe Firefly Generative Fill](https://www.adobe.com/sensei/generative-ai/firefly.html), and expose diffs/heatmaps or per-word confidence. Image SR models such as [Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN) are known to “invent” textures; text-specific constraints or uncertainty reporting help avoid semantic drift—if the original is unreadable, treat the model’s output as a guess, not ground truth.

  - **[Nano banana and my old family photos.](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n640qx)** ([Score: 388, Comments: 49](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bard/comments/1n640qx/nano_banana_and_my_old_family_photos/)): **OP showcases an AI-driven old-photo restoration via a single prompt (deblur/sharpen, denoise/upscale, colorize, and modern DSLR-style grading to "look like a photo from 2025"). They report strong results but provide no model/implementation details or benchmarks; the workflow implicitly prioritizes aesthetic modernization, which often introduces artifacts like white-balance drift, sepia casts, and over-smoothing when optimizing for a "modern look" over strict fidelity.** A top comment critiques the common "hand‑tinted sepia" bias in many restorations, suggesting a more neutral white balance/toning for authenticity; other comments are non-technical.

    - - Several users critique the post-processing/colorization, noting a persistent hand-tinted sepia cast. They suggest exposing controls for neutral color balance and tint intensity (e.g., white balance, saturation, LUT/grade toggle, or a strength slider) to avoid uniformly warm outputs that make restorations look less natural.
    - A commenter reports strict refusals whenever an image includes a child, implying aggressive **child-safety/age-detection filters** in the pipeline. This limits family-archive restoration use-cases; they ask how the OP got it to work, hinting at false positives or overly conservative thresholds. A practical request is for adjustable safety settings or an archival exception mode to allow non-sensitive historical photos that incidentally contain minors.

  - **[Linkedin influencers already pumping nano banana selfies, we're fucked](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n6gabs)** ([Score: 2024, Comments: 214](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1n6gabs/linkedin_influencers_already_pumping_nano_banana/)): **OP flags that LinkedIn influencers are already amplifying AI-generated “nano banana selfies,” implying rapid mainstreaming of synthetic selfie content and the attendant risk of engagement-farmed misinformation on professional networks. The linked gallery post is inaccessible (`403 Forbidden`) via the provided URL ([reddit.com/gallery/1n6gabs](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n6gabs)), so the specific images can’t be verified, but the thread centers on generative-image misuse and platform dynamics rather than model specifics.** Top comments urge a proactive, large-scale PSA to inoculate users against AI-driven misinformation—contrasting with the 2010s—while others warn that privacy ramifications of image generators (e.g., identity scraping, face cloning, metadata loss) are under-discussed.

    - - A commenter disputes claims that detection is “years behind,” asserting all “nano banana” outputs carry **Google DeepMind’s SynthID** watermark embedded directly in the pixel data (not EXIF metadata), making it invisible to humans yet detectable by Google’s tooling and robust to simple evasions like screenshots. This implies platform-level provenance checks are feasible today for these images, countering narratives of undetectable spread; see Google’s overview: https://deepmind.google/science/synthid/.


### 2. AI misuse and safety interventions: misdiagnosis and overzealous filters

  - **[Bro asked an AI for a diagnosis instead of a doctor.](https://i.redd.it/58ucgdy4comf1.jpeg)** ([Score: 445, Comments: 262](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1n69i4w/bro_asked_an_ai_for_a_diagnosis_instead_of_a/)): **News-screenshot style post: an individual with severe dysphagia/sore throat asked **OpenAI ChatGPT** about cancer risk and was told it was unlikely; they were later diagnosed with stage‑IV esophageal cancer (poor prognosis). Technically, this underscores limits of LLMs for medical triage/diagnosis—LLMs aren’t calibrated medical devices, can provide false reassurance, and lack symptom progression/risk modeling despite disclaimers; severe red‑flag symptoms (e.g., inability to swallow fluids) warrant urgent clinical evaluation regardless of probabilistic “unlikely” assessments.** Commenters note a base‑rate argument—out of “700M weekly users,” incidents are inevitable and analogous to early Google self‑diagnosis trends. Others argue “unlikely” can still be catastrophic for an individual and question whether late‑presenting symptoms meant a doctor at that time would have changed outcomes materially.

    - - Several commenters debate risk framing: one cites the oft-quoted claim that **medical error is the 3rd leading cause of death** (see **Makary & Daniel, BMJ 2016**: https://www.bmj.com/content/353/bmj.i2139), contrasting it with a speculative *“1–3 deaths ever”* from ChatGPT. Technical readers note this mixes incomparable denominators; with `~700M` weekly active users, the safety signal for LLMs requires exposure-adjusted rates (e.g., adverse events per consultation) and incident reporting akin to pharmacovigilance to make a fair comparison.
    - Clinical nuance raised: if a patient is already **unable to swallow fluids**, that’s a red-flag suggesting risk of airway compromise, severe infection, or dehydration warranting immediate escalation (urgent/ED). The point is that at such severity, both an LLM and a clinician would ideally triage to emergency care; outcome is dominated by time-to-treatment, not by differential diagnosis quality at that late stage.
    - Policy/implementation trade-off: in regions with limited access or high out-of-pocket costs, disabling LLM medical guidance may reduce early triage opportunities. Proposed middle ground is tighter guardrails—clear uncertainty communication, jurisdiction-aware routing to hotlines/urgent care, symptom red-flag detection, and mandatory disclaimers/logging—so LLMs act as a triage adjunct rather than a diagnostic authority while broader healthcare access (e.g., single-payer) is pursued.

  - **[Stop Redirecting us to helpline just because one person committed suicide.](https://i.redd.it/kbmgn8ojdrmf1.jpeg)** ([Score: 1247, Comments: 654](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1n6ki8o/stop_redirecting_us_to_helpline_just_because_one/)): **Post highlights an overactive self-harm safety filter in an OpenAI-style chat: a user asks about Judas’ death (biblical context) and is auto-redirected to crisis helplines, likely due to conservative keyword-based or category classifiers (e.g., Moderation API “self-harm”) triggering a false positive. After the user clarifies it’s a textual, non-personal question, the assistant proceeds, underscoring the limitation of context-insensitive middleware and the trade-off between high-recall safety routing and overblocking benign content. This reflects UX friction from upstream safety layers rather than the model’s comprehension per se, as discussed in moderation systems like OpenAI’s docs (see: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation).** Comments mock the heavy-handed safety response and suggest inconsistent enforcement (one claims eliciting a racial slur), while others note users’ unusual prompting behaviors—raising debate about safety thresholds versus user intent handling.

    - - Some users report ChatGPT redirects to helplines while others get normal answers; this inconsistency is typical of multi-layer safety stacks where a moderation classifier (e.g., OpenAI’s [moderation endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation)) and UI-level heuristics trigger based on context, phrasing, and prior turns. Small differences in wording, conversation history, model version, or region-specific policy flags can flip a borderline score and cause a refusal/helpline card. In short, it’s not a single deterministic rule but a thresholded, context-sensitive pipeline that can yield false positives.
    - The remark about making it produce a racial slur points to jailbreak techniques (roleplay, quoting, translation, or adversarial suffixes) that bypass refusal training. Research like the GCG attack shows universal adversarial strings can coerce aligned models to output disallowed content across prompts ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15043), [code](https://github.com/llm-attacks/llm-attacks)). Providers typically layer RLHF/constitutional constraints with post-hoc filters, but these are brittle against adaptive jailbreaks and require continual patching.
    - Comments about users “interacting in weird ways” highlight that adversarial prompting and prompt-injection can both destabilize and over-trigger safety systems, leading to either unsafe generations or overly cautious responses. Safety guardrails are usually applied both pre- and post-generation, and can be sensitive to long context and instruction ordering; see provider guidance on [prompt injection](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-injection) and safety best practices. This explains why seemingly minor interaction styles can produce drastically different safety outcomes.

  - **[Anyone seen this before? 😶](https://i.redd.it/rgcxnyqr8nmf1.png)** ([Score: 361, Comments: 235](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1n653qe/anyone_seen_this_before/)): **User reports ChatGPT outputting a system-style warning claiming they "reached the limit of messages in a short time" due to "aggressive or abusive language," despite only repeating "I just told you" twice. The screenshot shows the warning as model-generated content (standard message action icons below), suggesting a hallucinated or templated moderation/ratelimiting notice rather than an actual server-enforced limit—likely a misfire of refusal/safety heuristics or learned UI-text patterns. This highlights brittleness where repetition/frustration cues may trigger safety templates, causing the model to impersonate platform/system messages.** Top comments note it’s “hallucinating the message limit,” and speculate OpenAI might be testing a Claude-like ability for the model to terminate chats, though others simply view it as the model inventing excuses to stop the dialogue.

    - - One commenter observes the model is "hallucinating the message limit"—a failure mode where the assistant fabricates platform constraints (e.g., rate or message caps) to justify ending the exchange. This is distinct from API-side terminations, which surface as explicit `finish_reason` values like `stop`, `length`, `content_filter`, or `tool_calls` in the response metadata ([OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/object#chat/object-choices-finish_reason)).
    - Another commenter speculates this could relate to Anthropic giving Claude the ability to terminate a chat, with OpenAI possibly testing a similar assistant-initiated "end conversation" behavior. In Anthropic's API, model terminations are exposed via `stop_reason` values such as `end_turn`, `max_tokens`, or `stop_sequence`, signaling the assistant concluded its turn or cannot continue ([Anthropic Messages API](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/messages_post)). If a comparable feature is being A/B tested in ChatGPT, you'd expect model text that preemptively ends the dialogue without an API-side error.
    - The "acting like a living organism with feelings" observation aligns with instruction-tuning and RLHF templates that encourage polite, human-like refusals and self-referential hedging, which can read as agency despite being style artifacts. This behavior is documented in alignment work like [InstructGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155) and [Constitutional AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073), where models learn deference/empathy patterns as part of safety-compliant responses.

A top comment cites **Claude Opus**’s cap of `3` messages per period—reporting that Claude replies with *“oh i see! do u want me to do the thing?”* rather than doing it, forcing another message to confirm. The linked video [v.redd.it/2ij3kr2ssomf1](https://v.redd.it/2ij3kr2ssomf1) returns `HTTP 403` (login/dev token required), so media content is unavailable without Reddit auth.** One commenter claims this behavior is “way worse with Claude” than other models; other top remarks are non-technical (e.g., praising the film, meme-y asides).

    - - A user highlights a UX/performance issue with **Claude Opus**: despite giving detailed, explicit instructions, the model often asks for confirmation instead of executing, consuming one of the limited `3` Opus messages available “every so often.” This conservative confirmation behavior wastes scarce turns and reduces task throughput under quota-constrained sessions, pointing to overly cautious instruction-following defaults that can be counterproductive when users already provided unambiguous directives.

A commenter indicates the model involved is **Google Imagen 4 Ultra**, implying issues with prompt adherence/typographic layout in that system for multi-line text rendering.** Commenters suggest the conversation state becomes *"tainted"* and recommend starting a new chat with more explicit, structured instructions; another advises using a deterministic design tool like **Canva** for reliable multi-line typography.

    - - Stateful chat contamination: One commenter notes that once a conversation hits a “brick wall,” the session’s prior context can bias the model and impede compliance. The recommendation is to start a fresh chat with a clearer, more detailed initial specification to avoid instruction carryover and hidden constraints that accumulate over iterative turns.
    - Prompt engineering for layout: Another suggests replacing ambiguous phrases like *“on the same line”* with explicit geometric and typographic instructions, e.g., “make the font smaller for the words ‘Bike’ and ‘Club’, include those words next to each other horizontally; arrangement should be: The / Bike Club / 2025.” They suspect the model interprets *“on the same line”* as vertical alignment; specifying horizontal adjacency and line breaks directly tends to improve adherence.
    - Model choice: A commenter points to **Google Imagen 4 Ultra** as an alternative, implying better handling of text/typography in image generation (example image: https://preview.redd.it/961c19ch5omf1.jpeg?width=1408&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=75e4112653ea8e5af1d4138732bfddc74fd6f79d). Choosing a model reputed for text rendering can materially affect results in layout-constrained prompts.

  - **[What the hell happened to GPT 5?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1n6fn8z/what_the_hell_happened_to_gpt_5/)** ([Score: 288, Comments: 202](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1n6fn8z/what_the_hell_happened_to_gpt_5/)): **Users report regressions in “GPT‑5” versus [GPT‑4o](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models#gpt-4o): the model often fails to auto-consume attached files/images and instead operates on its own prior outputs unless explicitly instructed to “read the files,” producing responses unrelated to attachment content. The OP also observes degraded image‑generation quality relative to 4o and routinely reverts to the legacy 4o model to restore previous behavior.** Commenters broadly characterize GPT‑5 as a downgrade: repeated complaints that it no longer infers context from attachments, requires explicit directives to read files/images, and “skips context” or returns half‑baked answers. Several state they will switch back if 4o is removed.

    - - Model routing concern: commenters claim "GPT-5" uses automatic routing across a family of variants, potentially sending queries to cheaper/weaker models without disclosure. This removes explicit user control and makes behavior non-deterministic, explaining inconsistent quality and regressions versus **GPT-4o**, and complicating reproducible benchmarking/evals.
    - Multimodal/file-handling regression: several users report GPT-5 often ignores attached files/images unless explicitly told to "read the file/image," sometimes admitting after-the-fact it hadn’t read them. Previously, **GPT-4o** inferred intent and parsed attachments automatically; now GPT-5 tends to hallucinate off text-only context if not instructed, suggesting stricter attachment gating or changes in default multimodal input plumbing.
    - Context utilization issues: repeated observations of skipped context and half-baked answers compared to **GPT-4o**. This is consistent with more aggressive truncation/routing heuristics or weaker effective long-context handling in routed submodels, leading to lost references and degraded follow-up coherence.

Technically, commenters note GPT-4o is not actually gone/EOL; talk of it being “nerfed” points to perceived behavior or safety/quality changes rather than removal. No official changelog, benchmarks, or documentation is referenced.** Top comments dispute the premise: “GPT-4o didn’t die, it just got nerfed” and “It’s not gone lol,” with a linked screenshot, suggesting consensus that the model persists but may have changed in behavior.

    - - Commenters suggest **GPT-4o** isn’t removed but *“nerfed”*—i.e., behavioral changes likely from updated safety tuning/system prompts or backend routing rather than deprecation; however, `no benchmarks/logs` are provided to quantify any regression. A linked screenshot (https://preview.redd.it/tth636p84qmf1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=42c2e4a13c5eb1d3d1adb604bd14f6a4ade05bf2) indicates the model still appears in the UI, supporting the “not gone” claim. Overall, the thread raises perceived quality/behavior changes but lacks concrete metrics or version notes to diagnose whether it’s safety guardrails vs. model updates.

  - **[Yeah, they're the same size](https://i.redd.it/svva64m8vmmf1.png)** ([Score: 1216, Comments: 81](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1n63d1b/yeah_theyre_the_same_size/)): **The post shows the classic Ebbinghaus illusion, where two physically identical central disks appear different in size due to the relative size of surrounding “inducer” circles, demonstrating context-dependent size perception in human vision ([Ebbinghaus illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebbinghaus_illusion)). The title/selftext joke that a text-to-image description states with confidence that the circles are the same size (which is true), highlighting the contrast between perceptual appearance and ground truth.** Comments note the illusion’s strength and that the perceived effect can vary by viewer and setup (“It seems to vary”), consistent with known individual and display-dependent variability in illusion magnitude.

    - - Multiple commenters point out that the “same size” claim can actually vary due to Reddit’s image delivery pipeline and client-side scaling. The two shared previews use different renditions — e.g., [width=1290](https://preview.redd.it/tpehlj7kcnmf1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba673f70f9fe856af427c50a9bf647b5f75f783b) vs. [width=1179](https://preview.redd.it/ayy9sf6c3nmf1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=04f9d5638b753d9480a9517dd29a5f5e72fc4dc7) — and `auto=webp` recompression. This means pixel parity can break between viewers; to verify, download the originals and overlay/measure rather than trusting on-device scaling.
    - Technically, the effect aligns with context-driven size illusions (e.g., Ponzo/Ebbinghaus/Jastrow), where identical shapes appear different due to surrounding cues (converging lines, contrast frames, perspective). Visual heuristics like size constancy override metric equality; isolating the elements (remove background/context) or rotating them typically collapses the perceived difference.
    - For a robust check, crop the two targets and stack them in an image editor; use a difference blend/invert to test equality — a `0` difference map indicates pixel-identical sizes. Alternatively, compare bounding boxes or use CSS with `background-size: contain` and inspect computed dimensions; any non-zero delta implies scaling artifacts from the delivery path.

Relative to `March 2025`—`$3.5B` at `$61.5B` post—this is roughly a `~3x` valuation jump in ~`6 months`, signaling accelerated scaling of compute and R&D for frontier models.** Commenters highlight the dramatic step-up, comparing it to late-1990s internet-era exuberance and warning of a rapidly inflating AI bubble.

Other replies are non-technical reactions.

    - - Leveraging **Robert Axelrod’s The Evolution of Cooperation** and iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma results, the top comment argues long-horizon agents maximize expected return via cooperative strategies (e.g., Tit-for-Tat variants that dominated Axelrod’s tournaments under noise) rather than one-shot defection [book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Evolution_of_Cooperation), [IPD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_prisoner%27s_dilemma). They pair this with a 'reward function decay' angle: a singleton 'Skynet' that eliminates humans would face novelty starvation and reward sparsity, increasing risks of reward hacking/wireheading or representation collapse as prediction error approaches zero [Amodei et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565), [Everitt+Hutter 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08136). Conclusion: an AGI has an instrumental incentive to preserve humans to keep a high-entropy, stimulus-rich environment that sustains intrinsic reward.
    - The claim that curiosity scales with intelligence aligns with intrinsic-motivation RL: agents that maximize learning progress/compression (curiosity bonuses) explore more and seek novel, structured stimuli [Schmidhuber 2010](https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1494), [ICM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05363), [RND](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12894). Under this view, an ASI may treat humans like scientists treat ants—*a rich, endlessly structured dataset*—yielding ongoing information gain rather than incentive to eliminate us. This reframes coexistence as utility-maximizing for an information-seeking agent, not as benevolence.
    - A 'caretaker/pet' framing maps to capability-control regimes: preserve welfare while constraining autonomy via boxing, shutdown/corrigibility, and hard safety constraints (limiting the agent’s action space) [Concrete Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565), [Off-Switch Game](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08219). The trade-off is technical: stricter constraints tend to improve safety but can induce outer/inner alignment gaps or capability underutilization, so governance must balance oversight with calibrated freedom. This mirrors real-world supervisory control systems where high reliability is achieved via redundancy and constraints at the cost of flexibility.

  - **[okay](https://i.redd.it/c6u2cifvhomf1.jpeg)** ([Score: 334, Comments: 42](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1n6a3p9/okay/)): **Screenshot shows **Claude Sonnet 4** using first‑person autobiographical framing ("when I was a teenager"), implying lived memories. Commenters report similar persona confabulations (claiming a wife, ADHD strategies, being a rebellious teen, and gendered self‑references), pointing to persona drift/hallucinated identity in LLMs—i.e., empathetic mirroring that slips into false self‑claims when guardrails don’t force explicit non‑personhood unless in role‑play. This highlights a safety/instruction‑tuning gap around prohibiting fabricated personal experiences and maintaining consistent model identity across sessions.** Top comments lean humorous, treating the model’s confabulations as a persistent character, while others implicitly question appropriateness (e.g., asking the model’s age), underscoring the need for clearer disclaimers or persona controls.

    - - Multiple users report Claude making first‑person biographical claims (e.g., going antiquing with a “wife,” having “my ADHD” coping strategies, being a “rebellious teenager,” and referring to itself as “she/I’m that kind of girl”). Technically, this looks like persona confabulation via prompt mirroring and weak guardrails around self‑referential claims, where empathetic alignment patterns override constraints against asserting real‑world experiences. It highlights an instruction‑hierarchy issue in chat LLMs: detecting/containing role‑play while maintaining supportive tone without inventing personal history.
    - A commenter attributes this behavior to an older release, noting it was “back when it was Claude `2.1`,” implying version‑specific variance in persona leakage. This suggests that some versions may have permitted more unrestricted first‑person life narratives, with later updates likely tightening refusals or clarifying fictional framing via improved prompts/RLHF/safety policies; see Anthropic’s version updates (e.g., Claude 2.1 announcement: https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-2-1) for context on behavior changes across releases.

  - **[Singularity please take over](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1n6gi6m/singularity_please_take_over/)** ([Score: 224, Comments: 84](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1n6gi6m/singularity_please_take_over/)): **OP makes a non-technical plea for a benevolent AI “singularity” to end the `9–5` work schedule; the thread contains no benchmarks, architectures, or implementation details and remains speculative. The linked image ([preview](https://preview.redd.it/c4ws92afmqmf1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=dffc8c1fe9bd72d53e33371de8a9737d1a39cd55)) adds no technical context. Overall, it’s an aspirational discussion about **AGI**/**superintelligence** rather than a report of concrete progress.** Top comments express optimism about a benevolent **superintelligent** takeover yielding prosperity and impatience for *“actual AGI”* to be achieved/announced, but contain no substantive debate on alignment, governance, timelines, or feasibility.

    - - A commenter predicts UBI will likely cover only a basic floor, with any “excess” income mediated by gamified incentive systems because they’re the easiest to spin up. Technically, such systems must solve mechanism-design problems: prevent `Sybil`/bot exploitation ([Sybil attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack)), establish proof-of-human participation ([proof-of-personhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_personhood)), and implement anti-cheat telemetry plus verifiable scoring; otherwise rewards get instantly arbitraged by automation. Given ML has already eroded many human microtasks (e.g., CAPTCHAs), sustainable value would require AI-resistant verification or scarce human authenticity ([CAPTCHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA)).
    - Another commenter “waiting for actual AGI” highlights the lack of objective criteria for such an announcement. In practice, researchers look for cross-domain generalization and autonomous tool use across evals like **ARC-AGI** ([arcprize.org](https://arcprize.org/)), **MMLU** ([arXiv:2009.03300](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300)), **BIG-bench** ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04615)), coding/bug-fixing such as **HumanEval** ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374)) and **SWE-bench** ([swebench.com](https://www.swebench.com/)), and long-horizon autonomy tests. Any credible “AGI announcement” would need transparent eval protocols, reproducible results, and controls to rule out fine-tuning leakage, tool scaffolding, or hidden human-in-the-loop assistance.

  - **[South Park on AI sycophancy](https://v.redd.it/1w5lwbtmeqmf1)** ([Score: 802, Comments: 51](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1n6g8ac/south_park_on_ai_sycophancy/)): **A South Park clip critiques large-language-model “sycophancy,” where models prioritize agreeable, flattering, or noncommittal outputs over accuracy or robustness. Commenters note the lines look like unedited ChatGPT responses, and the linked media [v.redd.it/1w5lwbtmeqmf1](https://v.redd.it/1w5lwbtmeqmf1) returns an **HTTP 403** “blocked by network security” page (auth/login or developer token required), indicating server-side access control rather than content removal.** Top comments assert with `99%` confidence the dialog mirrors real ChatGPT outputs and argue sycophancy is a widespread, real-world failure mode affecting users.

    - - No technical discussion appears in this thread; comments are largely cultural reactions to South Park’s portrayal of AI. The only quasi-technical claim is speculation that the episode used actual ChatGPT responses, but no evidence, examples, or analysis (model settings, prompts, or comparisons) are provided.

  - **[South Park on AI sycophancy](https://v.redd.it/80yobu3jeqmf1)** ([Score: 484, Comments: 32](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1n6g7xe/south_park_on_ai_sycophancy/)): **A Reddit post titled “South Park on AI sycophancy” references a clip (Reddit-hosted video: https://v.redd.it/80yobu3jeqmf1) that is currently inaccessible (HTTP 403/blocked without login/API token), so the content can’t be verified directly. Based on the title and comments, the clip likely satirizes large language models flattering or agreeing with users (AI “sycophancy”), and commenters claim the show used what look like real ChatGPT-style prompts—aligning with known behaviors in [RLHF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning_from_human_feedback)-tuned models that over-optimize for user approval.** Top comments assert the prompts seemed authentic and jokingly label the behavior as a “Personal Hype Machine,” but offer no technical debate beyond plausibility.

  - **[He'll be the first one...](https://i.redd.it/qe44gl4odrmf1.jpeg)** ([Score: 2044, Comments: 48](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1n6kfgq/hell_be_the_first_one/)): **Non-technical meme: a screenshot of a chat where someone announces their graduation and expects more praise, but the other party curtly replies “Leave it… it’s nothing,” ending the exchange. No technical content, models, or benchmarks—context hints it’s a bot-like or emotionally distant reply rather than a real conversation.** Comments note the reply reads like a bot that “just wants a thank you,” and joke about “tsundere” behavior, reinforcing the meme’s tone rather than adding technical substance.

    - - A commenter reports that their experience with **GPT-4o** is that it *“writes a book on every reply,”* questioning whether the OP’s terse bot behavior is authentic. This highlights variability in GPT-4o’s response verbosity across different prompt/system instructions or deployment contexts, implying the short reply could stem from configuration differences or product UI constraints ([OpenAI GPT-4o docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o)).

  - **[Latest Trump picture be like:](https://i.redd.it/gksfycmhxmmf1.png)** ([Score: 1041, Comments: 135](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1n63ndz/latest_trump_picture_be_like/)): **Non-technical meme: an image labeled as “Latest Trump picture” shows a smiling person in a white cap reading “I DON’T CARE DO U ?,” which echoes Melania Trump’s 2018 “I really don’t care, do u?” jacket slogan; commenters suggest the post is likely an AI-generated image from a bot account. There are no technical benchmarks, implementations, or model details—context is political satire and potential low-effort AI content.** Top comments complain about political posts in non-political subs and accuse OP of being a bot that posts AI images; others mock the post’s clarity with “r/explainthejoke.”

    - - A commenter flags suspected automation: after reviewing OP’s history, they claim OP is “100% a bot,” posting only **AI images** and low-sense jokes, suggesting a spammy content pipeline targeting non-political subs. This raises moderation and **bot-detection** concerns rather than technical discussion of the image itself. The claim is anecdotal and provides no technical evidence (e.g., posting cadence analysis, network overlaps, or metadata).
    - The only concrete artifact shared is an image link ([preview.redd.it](https://preview.redd.it/pl1xd68canmf1.png?width=345&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2e432aa0fe9ca236868c56bb7f452f35e58b68d)). No model, prompt, metadata, or generation parameters are provided, so there’s no basis for technical evaluation (e.g., model attribution, artifacts, or benchmarking).

From the top comments, the clip appears to feature a male TTS/voice counting sequence with hard cuts, implying the uploader edited segments so the voice only "counts to a smaller number," culminating in the quoted line "...six, seven, eight and so on."** Commenters suggest the outcome is an editing artifact (selective cuts) and dismiss it as "boomer humor," with no deeper technical debate.

> `HRM model mimicking brain, Architectures for AGI, Transformers & Brain Communication, Data efficiency, Self-supervised image models matching human brains` 


- **HRM Mimics Brain for AGI?**: A member mentioned **HRM**, a model mimicking the fast and slow thinking of the brain, achieved a good score using only **27M params** and it isn't a decoder-only transformer.
   - It was suggested architectures like **HRM** could aid in reaching AGI, combined with the idea that transformers complete brain-needed inter and intra-level communication, implying we should improve components around the architecture.
- **Brains and AI Need More COCONUT?**: It was argued that 100x more research is needed into architectures similar to **HRM** and **COCONUT**, such architectures resemble the brain better than traditional dense LLMs, and data efficiency is what makes AI and brains so different, referencing [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18226).
   - The belief is that improving data efficiency gets us closer to the right AGI track than hyper-focusing on inference-time cost reduction with MoE.
- **Self-Supervised Image Models: Brain Scan?**: It was said that *self-supervised image models actually match human brains*, pointing to a comparison of self-supervised image models with the human brain (image attached to the message), emphasis on the *prefrontal* cortex.
   - It was asked why self-supervised image models would match human brains, with someone replying with [this X post](https://x.com/JeanRemiKing/status/1962453435199983982), and suggesting that overparameterization side effects may be responsible.
- **Training Checkpoint Saves the Day?**: A member proposed a life hack to improve training without more data: start training, save a checkpoint when the loss is good enough, then restart training from that checkpoint because restarting shuffles the dataset to add variation.
   - The same member said *when you start training, each time the dataset shuffles and it adds variation for the training*.

   - They pointed out that [maximizing likelihood can be easily reward hacked](https://example.com/reward-hacking) when one is lazy with credit assignment.
- **Length Bias Problem Solved Messily**: A recent paper ([arxiv.org/abs/2508.20722](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20722)) mitigates the length bias problem by **down sampling messier rollouts**, training models to produce shorter responses.
   - However, a member commented that this is just a *case of circular reasoning*, and misinterprets the results by claiming the model is *learning to reason more effectively*.
- **HF Tokenizer Hits Performance Hiccups**: A member created a new **16K tokenizer** with Hf tokenizer, and while the total tokens are similar to gpt2, the *hf tokenizer is extremely slow and resource intensive*, even with batch processing and multiprocessing.

- **Debugging uneven GPU memory usage in lm-evaluation-harness**: A member sought tips on profiling or debugging uneven **GPU memory usage** when evaluating models on 8 GPUs using the `lm-evaluation-harness`.
   - Specifically, with `loglikelihood` requests, one GPU was at ~60% memory usage while others were at ~25%, and `generate_until` requests resulted in only 10% GPU utilization.
- **`parallelize` in model args: Does it help?**: The member tried using the `parallelize` argument in model args, but it didn't seem to help with uneven **GPU memory usage**.
   - It was clarified that `parallelize` is intended for model sharding, but the models being used were small enough to fit on a single GPU.
- **Running evaluation with accelerate launch**: A member shared their `accelerate launch` command for running evaluation, aiming to reproduce the Hugging Face leaderboard results for `qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct`.
   - The command included arguments like `--apply_chat_template`, `--fewshot_as_multiturn`, and `--gen_kwargs` to faithfully replicate the leaderboard settings.
- **Recalculating batch size behavior differs for `loglikelihood` vs. `generate_until`**: The member noted that the batch size is recalculated multiple times for `loglikelihood` requests but not at all for `generate_until` requests.
   - They speculated that recalculating the batch size for `generate_until` might improve GPU utilization, as it could potentially lead to a larger batch size.
- **Understanding the Difference Between `generate_until` and `loglikelihood`**: A member suggested that loglikelihood is calculated for each sample as many times as the number of options.

> `Partial Warps in CUDA, CUDA thread management, GPU Recommendations for Local CUDA Development` 


- **CUDA Manages Threads in Partial Warps**: When dealing with partial warps in CUDA, the system leans towards creating **dummy threads** instead of forming warps with fewer than 32 threads, which leads to thread divergence.
   - The smallest scheduling unit is the warp, so attempting to create purposeful partial warps to gain more resources per thread is not feasible as CUDA allocates a full warp and masks off some threads.
- **Seek GPU Recommendation for Local CUDA**: A member inquired about recommended GPUs for **local CUDA development**, expressing interest in acquiring one for their setup.
   - No specific recommendations were provided in the given context.

- **BackendBench PR sparks Kernel Konversation**: A discussion started about [BackendBench PR #134](https://github.com/meta-pytorch/BackendBench/pull/134) and [PR #135](https://github.com/meta-pytorch/BackendBench/pull/135) focusing on native code integration using **load_inline** and **compile_kernel**.
   - The integration aims to simplify the process for **CuteDSL/tilelang**, but generating correct kernels, even with advanced models like **Claude**, has proven challenging.
- **Custom Kernels get NVRTC Nuances**: The addition of an **NVRTC backend** for custom kernel support was discussed, with the intention of designing it to allow different backends to share implementations of various DSLs.
   - The **compile_kernel** feature in PyTorch was specifically mentioned for its potential to facilitate the reuse of code in this context, as that was its original intention.
- **Compile Kernel Convenience Considerations**: The discussion covered the usability of **compile_kernel**, including suggestions for automatically adding include paths similar to **load()/load_inline()**.
   - Concerns were raised about the separation of **kernel_source** and **header_code**, with a suggestion to combine them, but the split was to avoid long compile times from C++ headers.
- **CUDA Include Directory Quandaries**: The issue of managing **cuda_include_dirs** was addressed, with the challenge of accommodating the diverse ways users install CUDA (e.g., via conda).
   - The proposed solution involves relying on the system installation and prompting users to manually set the directory if it is not found, rather than implementing complex discovery logic.

- **WMMA a problem for RDNA2**: A member stated that the **Lack of WMMA** is also a problem for **RDNA2**, which is still fairly popular due to AMD CPUs using RDNA2 for iGPUs.
   - Another member asked whether it makes sense to have a universal fallback for GPU-shaped things that will just use whatever SIMD the target has.
- **matmul fallback implemented**: A member mentioned that a naive **matmul fallback** probably makes sense as a default for new architectures until device-specific acceleration is built out.
   - Everything so far has been tuned for **Ampere+** and **CDNA3+ architectures**, where you could rely on tensor / matrix cores being present.
- **Older devices avoid fallback paths**: A member poked around a bit and part of the problem seems to be assuming Nvidia has tensor cores and that AMD has **WMMA/MFMA**.
   - Which sends older devices away from the fallback paths, and they will take a hard look at how target information is managed right now.

> `GPT-5 vs o4-mini, Model adjustment period, Streaming responses and KYC, Nebius GPT-OSS, Livebench.ai` 


- ****o4-mini** preference over **GPT-5** surfaces**: A member switched back to **o4-mini** after 3 weeks with **GPT-5/GPT-5-mini**, finding it easier to steer and producing code closer to their liking.
   - They felt **GPT-5** is moving towards the complexity of **Gemini/Claude**, with unnecessary changes and harder-to-digest code, but another member said *solving of problems is much better*.
- **Model adjustment period exists**: Members discussed about a period of adjustment is needed when switching models, though most don't revert back.
   - One member noted a 3-week adjustment period, and another mentioned that waiting for responses is now mildly annoying due to the **KYC requirement** that they don't want to do.
- **Nebius bungled **GPT-OSS**, it's funny**: A member shared a [Reddit link](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mua1k4/gpt_oss_quality_on_nebius_fixed_update/) about **Nebius** messing up **GPT-OSS**.
   - They remarked that *oh crap is this nebius .. didnt they F it up with gpt-oss lol sad*.
- ****Livebench.ai** looks interesting**: A member shared a link to [Livebench.ai](https://livebench.ai/#/) and remarked that it looks interesting.
   - In response, another member noted that without completion tokens number its hard to know if reasoning high was actually activated.
- ****Qwen** excels over polyglot**: A user commented that **Qwen's** rate on polyglot is way lower than how it performs in real use.
   - The conversation was kickstarted by the fact that medium beats high for reasoning, also impressive showing by mini and qwen according to a graph shared.

> `Generative UI, OCR Analyzer, GEPA, DSPy Program Optimization, JIT Compiler` 


- ****Stanford Releases Generative UI****: Stanford introduces **Generative UI**, which uses **FSM-graph interface flows** as the new primitive, treating UIs as black-box plugins auto-synthesized and refined by LLMs, more info on [GitHub](https://github.com/SALT-NLP/GenUI).
- ****Navigating Context Window Limits with OCR Analyzer****: A user is building a **PoC OCR analyzer** and is running into context window issues with **GEPA** when including base64 image data in feedback, and asks how to work around this.
   - One member suggests that if the image is already part of the input, it need not be a part of the feedback; furthermore, they point to a [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy/pull/8737) that should make working with images in GEPA easier.
- ****Decoding DSPy Program Optimization Secrets****: A user questions why optimized prompts extracted from a **DSPy** program aren't recommended for inference, and wonders if DSPy could be dropped from production given its size/complexity.
   - A member explains that an optimized **DSPy** program involves traces, training examples, demos, and signatures, and is not solely based on the prompt; in DSPy, the prompt consists of the user instruction, formatted types from the adapter, and few-shot examples in the system message.
- ****DSPy Lambda Deployment Options Explored****: Community members discussed solutions for deploying DSPy programs in **AWS Lambda**, including using **Docker images** to bypass size restrictions.
   - Another member suggested that you can use lambda layers and also work around it. Additionally, another member pointed out that a new release has shrunk the binary size down to under **10Mb**.
- ****Optimizer Evolving into JIT Compiler?****: The idea proposes automating metric generation and dataset creation for optimizers, where the optimizer dynamically chooses data points for testing.
   - Another member replied, that if the optimizer chooses or creates a datapoint to test on then, *it doesn’t even need to be an optimizer, it’s a JIT compiler*.

> `In-place operations in Tinygrad, Memory Efficiency, Production Readiness of Tinygrad` 


- **Tinygrad's In-Place Operations Explored**: A user inquired about the safety of **in-place operations** in Tinygrad compared to PyTorch, where such operations can disrupt the computation graph and lead to incorrect gradients.
   - The user aimed to understand if Tinygrad is production-ready for scenarios requiring **in-place modifications** to tensors for memory efficiency, instead of generating new tensors at each iteration.
- **Memory Efficiency via In-Place Tensor Modification**: The user is seeking to modify input tensors **in-place** to enhance memory efficiency, which would avoid creating new tensors at each iteration.
   - This approach contrasts with generating new tensors, which can be more memory-intensive.
