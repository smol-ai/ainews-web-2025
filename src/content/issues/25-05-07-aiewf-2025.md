It's a quiet day, but as we did [almost exactly a year ago](https://news.smol.ai/issues/24-05-22-ainews-all-of-ai-engineering-in-one-place), we'll spend an issue talking about the new [speakers announced](https://x.com/aiDotEngineer/status/1920247450096579010) for the second large-scale AI Engineer World's Fair next month:

The first World's Fair was a big experiment - is AI Engineering big enough to warrant its own large multitrack conference? We were fortunate to [be the first to preview capabilities](https://news.smol.ai/issues/24-06-28-ainews-that-gpt-4o-demo) that now every single AI Engineer can build with and take for granted. In between then and now, the [NYC Summit](https://news.smol.ai/issues/25-02-21-ainews-ai-engineer-summit-day-1) blew out all expectations, with [4 Madison Square Gardens worth](https://www.youtube.com/@aiDotEngineer/streams) of people tuning in on the livestream and a [viral MCP workshop](https://www.latent.space/p/why-mcp-won).

### The 2025 AI Engineer World's Fair (Jun 3-5 in SF)

AIEWF 2025 is now **2x as big again** as last year, with expo booths, talks, workshops across 18 tracks. You can browse the [llms.txt](https://www.ai.engineer/llms.txt) or [llms-full.txt,](https://www.ai.engineer/llms-full.txt) to get up to speed on the evolving meta of AI Engineering:

- **Expanded tracks**:
    - The "RAG" track that every AI conference has is really a bundle of deeper problems: **Retrieval + Search** (now that LLMs are increasingly being [bundled with web search](https://www.anthropic.com/news/web-search-api)), **GraphRAG** (Neo4J returns to expand upon [one of the most popular talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knDDGYHnnSI&t=1s&pp=0gcJCYUJAYcqIYzv) from last year), and **RecSys** (inspired by [Eugene Yan's coverage](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/recsys-llm/), who is now hosting this track)
    - The "Agents" track no longer makes sense when [2025 is the year of agents](https://www.latent.space/p/agent). Since everything is becoming agentic and nobody agrees on definitions, we are simply double clicking on the three most urgent agent hotspots: **SWE-Agents,** **Agent Reliability,** and **Reasoning + RL** (again taking signal from a [top NYC talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIsgyk0Paic&t=54s&pp=0gcJCYUJAYcqIYzv)).
    - "Multimodality" also is now broken up into special focuses on **Voice AI** ([realtime voice APIs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbToUiWRhn4&t=972s)) and **Generative Media** (image/video generation)
    - **Infrastructure, Security** and **Evals** finally get their own track (with [Braintrust](https://www.braintrust.dev/), one of [the top Latent Space episodes](https://www.latent.space/p/braintrust) of the year)
- **Maturing Leadership**: Per [the Bret Taylor pod](https://www.latent.space/p/bret), the role of "AI Leadership" is now increasingly owned by **AI Architects**, and we've also moved the **AI in the Fortune 500** case studies and war stories to double options for those who build AI in the enterprise.
- **Brand New Directions:**
    - **MCP** the single most oversubscribed track.
    - **Tiny Teams** building [companies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDiEQngFsFU&t=832s) with more millions in ARR than employees.
    - **Product Management** a track for the PMs that work closely with AI Engineers.
    - **Design Engineering** similar; except AI Designers are increasingly also engineers.
    - **Robotics and Autonomy** covers the latest in embodied LLMs - with new foundation models info from Waymo, Tesla, Google and more
- Of course, the most important track is the unlisted one: **the hallway track**, which last year was incredible, but of course you simply had to be there.

If the curation here/on Latent Space has the most cosine similarity with your interests, **this conference was made for you**. See you in SF June 3-5!

# AI Reddit Recap

## /r/LocalLlama Recap

### 1. New SOTA AI Models, Benchmarks, and Training Innovations

- [**New SOTA Apache Fine tunable Music Model!**](https://v.redd.it/q5yriuw3hbze1) ([Score: 303, Comments: 86](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1kgry9y/new_sota_apache_fine_tunable_music_model/)): **The ACE-Step model ([Github](https://github.com/ace-step/ACE-Step), [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/ACE-Step/ACE-Step-v1-3.5B)) is a newly released open-source, Apache-licensed generative model for music that is fine-tunable and features extremely fast inference: benchmarks report 3 minutes of music generated in 34s on an RTX 4070, and sub-3s for shorter clips on a 4090. Model weights, demo, and code are available, and the architecture is designed for local use with potential ComfyUI integration. Community feedback confirms impressive generation speed and prompt-following precision, but observers note audio quality (especially timbre and style variety) is still behind proprietary SOTA models like Suno and Udio.** Experts emphasize the model's leap in local, high-speed music generation and seek integrations (e.g., ComfyUI), while recognizing that audio quality does not yet match closed-source leaders.
    - Users are reporting exceptionally fast music generation speeds: one cited 3 seconds for output on an Nvidia 4090 and another stated 34 seconds for 3 minutes of music on a 4070, while even a 3060 provides "absolutely incredible" performance. This speed surpasses most commercial solutions, at least under default settings.
    - Several users highlight mixed audio quality—the generation model excels in creative output and prompt adherence, but its sound is described as *"still quite a bit lower than Suno or Udio"* in terms of both instrumentation and vocals. The audio often resembles an overly compressed mp3; suggestions include tweaking settings to potentially enhance quality.
    - There is technical interest in integrating the model into ComfyUI, with users offering to build an implementation if one does not exist, reflecting demand for greater tooling and support within ecosystem workflows.
- [**Self-improving AI unlocked?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1kgr5h3/selfimproving_ai_unlocked/) ([Score: 136, Comments: 41](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1kgr5h3/selfimproving_ai_unlocked/)): **The Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR) introduces a paradigm where a language model self-generates tasks to optimize its own learning, using a code-execution environment for automatic reward verification, thereby eliminating any need for external, human-curated data. According to the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03335), AZR achieves state-of-the-art results on coding and mathematical reasoning benchmarks—even outperforming prior zero-shot approaches dependent on large supervised datasets—and demonstrates scalability across various model sizes and classes. This approach extends reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to a fully self-sustaining, data-free regime, leveraging only the model's own curriculum evolution and code-based validation as the ground truth signal.** Top comments highlight the shift towards models that autonomously construct and adapt their learning distributions as a potential breakthrough that could "free reasoning models from the constraints of human-curated data," referencing a possible new era of self-improving AI. One commenter equates this to an "AlphaZero moment" for large language models applied to coding and mathematics, reflecting consensus that this marks a major advance in autonomous reasoning.
    - The paper describes a shift towards reasoning models (notably AZR) that can define and evolve their own learning task distributions in interaction with an environment, reducing reliance on curated human data. This is compared to freeing models from human-curated constraints and is positioned as a parallel to a new phase in reasoning models, per citations (Morris, 2025; Silver & Sutton, 2025; Zhao et al., 2024).
    - Commenters draw an analogy to AlphaZero in the context of LLMs for coding and math, emphasizing that AlphaZero learned purely from the rules of the game via self-play, whereas the 'Absolute Zero Reasoner' model builds on pre-existing abilities (e.g., reading, writing, coding). There is debate about whether 'zero' should truly indicate no prior human knowledge or whether the model's performance derives partly from pre-trained capabilities.
    - A technical excerpt from the paper demonstrates AZR (Absolute Zero Reasoner-Llama3.1-8b at step 132) handling deliberately obfuscated Python tasks designed to challenge both humans and machine learning models, showing the system's practical ability to tackle adversarial reasoning or code comprehension challenges.
- [**I've trained a LTXV 13b LoRA. It's INSANE**](https://v.redd.it/auhuocl14dze1) ([Score: 487, Comments: 43](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1kgxgtg/ive_trained_a_ltxv_13b_lora_its_insane/)): **A user fine-tuned an LTXV 13B video diffusion model using a LoRA adapter, trained on 22 video samples for 2,000 steps via the official [Lightricks LTX-Video-Trainer](https://github.com/Lightricks/LTX-Video-Trainer) on an H100 GPU (using Runpod) in roughly 1 hour. The resultant LoRA, shared on [CivitAI](https://civitai.com/models/1553692?modelVersionId=1758090), is compatible with ComfyUI after conversion (using the _comfy suffix) and includes workflow/YAML instructions; this demonstrates immediate community ability to extend state-of-the-art video diffusion models with minimal compute and default hyperparameters.** Commentary highlights both the rapidity of LoRA finetuning by the community (reacting within a day of model release) and concerns about hardware accessibility (noting challenges for users with GPUs like the 3090/4090). Requests for the user's workflow and tips signal growing interest in reproducibility and best practices for LoRA video diffusion finetuning.
    - Discussion highlights the rapid pace of community adaptation, noting that a LoRA version of the LTXV 13B model was trained and released within just one day of the base model's availability. This underscores both the accessibility of LoRA finetuning and the enthusiasm among users leveraging consumer hardware such as the RTX 3090, despite resource constraints.
- [**SamsungCam UltraReal - Flux Lora**](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kh6if7) ([Score: 256, Comments: 29](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1kh6if7/samsungcam_ultrareal_flux_lora/)): **The post introduces "SamsungCam UltraReal - Flux Lora," a custom LoRA designed to replicate Samsung-style photographic realism, particularly for Flux-based generative AI models. The LoRA emphasizes enhanced fine detail (e.g., pores, hair strands), reduces 'plastic doll' skin artifacts typical in many generative models, and partially replicates Samsung's vibrant color science. While optimized for the creator's UltraReal Fine-Tune (https://civitai.com/models/978314/ultrareal-fine-tune), it is compatible with base [Flux.dev](http://flux.dev/) but may display image glitches (notably with hands) at high (2MP) generation resolutions.** Commenters note a marked improvement in perceived realism, highlighting that this LoRA delivers on its promise of more lifelike outputs compared to standard models. A light-hearted remark about activating Windows appears but is not technically substantive.
    - A user inquires about the optimal workflow for character fine-tuning: whether using the Ultrareal checkpoint with Kohya's Dreambooth would yield good results or if it's preferable to train a LoRA on the base [Flux.dev](http://flux.dev/) model and apply it to Ultrareal. The question signals an interest in fine-tune stacking, model compatibility, and the potential effect of upstream checkpoints on personalization quality.

### 2. Open Source AI Video and Image Generation Tools & Compression

- [**Generated this entire video 99% with open source & free tools.**](https://v.redd.it/2kat9wm8geze1) ([Score: 624, Comments: 69](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1kh45tx/generated_this_entire_video_99_with_open_source/)): **The OP details a near 100% open-source/free video creation pipeline combining tools like ComfyUI with custom workflows (using Flux Turbo, Redux, Gemini 1.2 Flash for consistent characters), Wan2.2 and Skyreels for image-to-video synthesis, AudioX for generating SFX, Suno 4.5 for music, and Zono for TTS, with only Enhancor (skin realism) paid. CapCut was used as the final editing platform, and ControlNets were integrated for output fidelity, collectively showcasing a robust, modular AI content stack. More details can be found in the original [Reddit post](https://v.redd.it/2kat9wm8geze1).** Top technical feedback notes that the process is about 89% free due to the single paid component (Enhancor), and otherwise highlights appreciation for the workflow and queries regarding the video's actual thematic content rather than workflow-specific critiques.
    - A commenter highlights the video's strong character consistency, asking whether it was achieved by training a LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model on a real set of photos, or if additional methods or tools were involved. This references technical details related to personalized image/video generation and training approaches.
- [**Run FLUX.1 losslessly on a GPU with 20GB VRAM**](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1kgz03q/run_flux1_losslessly_on_a_gpu_with_20gb_vram/) ([Score: 217, Comments: 66](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1kgz03q/run_flux1_losslessly_on_a_gpu_with_20gb_vram/)): **The post announces losslessly compressed versions of the 12B FLUX.1-dev and FLUX.1-schnell models using DFloat11 ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11651)), which applies entropy coding to BFloat16 weights for ~30% size reduction (from 24GB to ~16.3GB) with no output changes. This enables these large models to inference on a single 20GB+ VRAM GPU, incurring only a brief per-image overhead. Downloads and usage examples are provided via [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/DFloat11/FLUX.1-dev-DF11) and [LeanModels GitHub](https://github.com/LeanModels/DFloat11/tree/master/examples/flux.1).** The primary technical query in comments is whether DFloat11 could be applied to other large models such as SDXL, primarily for storage space reduction, and there's interest in upcoming support for alternative UIs/runtimes like Forge and Comfy.
    - A commenter questions the practical utility of DF11 compression compared to existing methods, specifically citing INT8_SYM weights-only compression as already being nearly lossless, reporting it yields *"a total of 0 to 10 different pixels on the output image"* with about `30%` more compression than DF11. This raises a challenge to the claimed advantages of the DF11 approach for model size reduction and fidelity.
    - Technical concerns are raised about the transparency and reproducibility of the compression method: a request is made for the release of both compression code and the source for the `decode.ptx` file, with skepticism expressed regarding its provenance (noting that it was generated by NVIDIA's NVVM Compiler rather than hand-written). This underscores the necessity of releasing source artifacts for community validation and extension.
    - There are inquiries into broader applicability, specifically whether the technique can be used with SDXL checkpoints (for storage savings) and with video models, suggesting technical interest in generalizing the method to various model classes beyond its original scope.

### 3. Major Industry Shifts: Google, Reddit, and OpenAI AI Impact

- [**A year ago Google bought the rights to use Reddit content for their AI training, now their model is supreme**](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1kgtyzr/a_year_ago_google_bought_the_rights_to_use_reddit/) ([Score: 373, Comments: 119](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1kgtyzr/a_year_ago_google_bought_the_rights_to_use_reddit/)): **The post references Google's 2023 licensing deal obtaining the rights to use Reddit data for AI training (see: [WSJ coverage](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/google-reddit-deal-ai-training-80d2f075)), suggesting a link between access to Reddit content and Google's model advancement. Top commenters emphasize that, despite Google's formal agreement, most AI labs (OpenAI, Meta, etc.) had already scraped Reddit data without permission, meaning the legal access likely made little technical difference in model capability or training. Another technical observation links the internet's meme/benchmark culture to model evaluation, implying overlap between Reddit's contributor base and those designing AI benchmarks.** Some debate the practical impact of Google's deal, arguing the access was not unique nor critical since the AI community widely scraped Reddit previously, thus the deal was largely symbolic or legal rather than yielding a technical edge.
    - Several commenters point out that while Google paid for Reddit content, other AI labs have historically scraped Reddit data without formal agreements, suggesting there is likely no direct technical advantage gained from the purchase itself. The implication is that *the rights agreement is more about legal or ethical alignment than unique training data access* since most major language models have already incorporated Reddit data.
    - Glxblt76 emphasizes that Reddit offers inherent content curation through its upvote system, which could benefit AI training by ensuring *higher quality or more representative user-generated data* enters the training set. This curation could indirectly influence model performance, as curated datasets are often correlated with improved downstream results.
    - Express-Set-1543 makes the point that the overlap between Reddit contributors and benchmark creators may introduce *distributional alignment* between training and evaluation data, potentially resulting in higher scores on commonly-used benchmarks—especially those devised by the same technical communities active on Reddit.
- [**AI ironically destroying Google. Stock dropped 10% today on declining Safari browser searches.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1kh6aa7/ai_ironically_destroying_google_stock_dropped_10/) ([Score: 336, Comments: 153](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1kh6aa7/ai_ironically_destroying_google_stock_dropped_10/)): **The post discusses the technical implications of AI-powered chat (LLMs) on Google's ad-driven business, particularly after a 10% stock drop linked to declining Safari browser search volume. The poster argues that AI assistants may decrease both Google's core search revenue and third-party display ad revenue by reducing web visits, while also noting the user-unfriendliness of inserting ads directly into LLMs (e.g., Gemini). Financial data cited includes Google's heavy reliance on advertising. No major new benchmarks, model releases, or implementation details provided.** Commenters engage in a technical debate: Several highlight that search ads (especially for commercial intent queries) remain difficult to fully replace with LLMs, and stress that Google's diversified ad ecosystem (YouTube, Android, display networks) buffers revenue impact. Others note that ad monetization within chatbots lacks a proven model, which partly explains OpenAI's subscription approach. The competitive technical positioning of Google's AI is also cited as a strategic advantage.
    - Discussion centers on the complexity of search ad revenue displacement: chatbots like ChatGPT or Gemini have not significantly eroded Google’s core search ad business because chatbot interaction models are not conducive to effective ad placements—unlike traditional web, app, or video search contexts where user intent to transact or click through is clearer and highly monetizable.
    - Several users stress that technical advances in Google's AI (such as 'Deep Research' on Gemini Advanced) reflect a strategic shift towards more sophisticated, subscription-based AI products, but current reliance on traditional search for high-value queries means semantic search/chatbots are not immediately replacing key revenue streams.
    - A significant technical and financial risk noted is the market’s reaction to antitrust proceedings regarding Google’s search dominance, particularly their deal with Apple to be the default search provider in Safari; regulatory changes threaten a revenue stream worth ~$20 billion/year, and are seen as more impactful to share price than AI-induced search disruption at present.

> `Phi-3.5 Finetuning, Phi-4 Confusion, GGUF Finetuning, Qwen3 Training, Gradient Accumulation` 


- **Phi-3.5 Has Stopping Problem**: A member noticed that finetuning LLMs like **Phi-3.5** only uses **<|end|>** to signal stops, causing it to generate until the token limit.
   - They also noted that the default tokenizer's padding token is **<|placeholder6|>** but ended up appending **tokenizer.eos_token** at the end.
- **Phi-4 Tokenizer Confuses Newbies**: It was brought up that **Unsloth fixed a bug** where **padding and EOS tokens** were the same, and that **Phi-4** has a different chat template than **Phi-3.5**.
   - Specifically, the tokenizer for *unsloth/Phi-4-mini-instruct* uses the **Phi-3 tokenizer**, which means tokenizing "<|im_start|>" results in *[27, 91, 321, 10949, 91, 29]* rather than a special token.
- **GGUF Isn't Finetunable**: A member asked whether to finetune from a **GGUF checkpoint** or a **4-bit one**, clarifying that GGUF is applied after finetuning for inference optimization.
   - Another member clarified that *you cannot finetune GGUF*, considering it a compiled app opposed to source code.
- **Qwen3 Suffers Kaggle Issues**: A member training **Qwen3** on Kaggle faced issues using 2 GPUs, noting Unsloth doesn't yet support multiple GPUs, despite the notebook being configured for two T4s.
   - Another member linked to a blogpost regarding gradient accumulation: [Unsloth Gradient Accumulation Issues](https://unsloth.ai/blog/gradient) that occurs when inheriting a trainer class.
- **Pad Token Switcheroo**: Members noticed that the `tokenizer_config.json` differs between `unsloth/Qwen3-0.6B-Base` and `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B-Base` on HF.

- **Atomic Addition Anomaly**: A user encountered an issue with **Triton** where running the same input resulted in slightly different outputs across different runs with a custom **matmul** implementation on an **A100** using **fp16**.
   - They suspected it was related to **atomic operations** but noted that the issue didn't occur with other kernels using the same atomic addition; another user chimed in that if you use `atomic_add` then you can definitely get different results.
- **Floating Point Precision Problems**: A user asked if the issue was specifically related to atomic addition with **fp16**, wondering if the order of mathematical sums should matter with relaxed atomic addition.
   - Another user stated that the order in which floating point results are added can indeed lead to different results, regardless of precision, illustrating with the classic example `1e-8 + 1e8 - 1e8`.

> `A6000 Ada, L40s, 4090, ECC Memory, Vast.ai Quality` 


- **A6000 Ada Faster Than L40s Out-of-Box**: The **A6000 Ada** often outperforms the **L40s** in stock settings, while the **4090** is the fastest among the Ada cards, despite the **L40s** having more tensorcore power on paper.
   - The performance discrepancy may be due to **ECC being enabled by default on the L40s** but disabled on the A6000 Ada, but cloud providers do not allow disabling this.
- **L40s Has Benefits Over 4090**: The **L40s** offers benefits over the **4090**, including **ECC memory**, **passive cooling**, different drivers, stability, and potentially better efficiency due to lower clocks.
- **A40 is the King of Token/$**: When renting, the **A40** is the top performer in tokens per dollar in the 4x GB category, while the **A6000 Ada** leads in the Ada 4x GB category, based on stock settings from cloud providers.
- **4090 Servers Overheat More**: **4090 servers** tend to have more overheating issues compared to L40s servers, possibly due to poor setup, and NVIDIA forbids 4090 use in datacenters.
   - A member notes that sites like **Vast.ai** having 4090s in their "verified datacenters" is suspicious.
- **Strange L40s Inefficiencies**: Despite having more tensorcore power, the **L40s** doesn't outperform the **A6000 Ada**, and the **L40s** performs similarly to the **L40** for LLM inference, even though the L40 has half the flops.
   - Actual performance in tokens/sec/$ matters more than specs due to other performance-impacting factors; this user also linked to [a tweet showing other users complaining about L40s perf](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GpZ6DJwWMAAbABA?format=jpg&name=large).

   - They wondered if the `torch.cuda.graph` already creates a new stream for recording the graph, and why that isn't sufficient to **isolate the graph capture**.
- **Isolation Concerns with Graph Capture in CUDAGraphs**: The discussion revolves around whether `torch.cuda.graph` sufficiently isolates graph capture when a new stream is already created for recording the graph.
   - The user seeks to understand the necessity of an additional stream for warmup, questioning if the existing stream provided by `torch.cuda.graph` is inadequate for isolation.

   - The *harvest_resource/server.lua* was identified as broken on main and reverting to an older version fixed the issue, but tests continued to fail because of the new import strategy.
- ****Import Impasse**: New Strategy Snafus Tests!**: The new import strategy, involving absolute imports, caused tests using relative imports to fail, particularly when checking `isinstance(entity, Prototype)` across different files.
   - Additionally, the new import structure reportedly broke things throughout the codebase, as pydantic did not recognize classes as being the same when imported differently.
- ****Factorio Frustration**: Mismatched CRCs Cause Desyncs!**: A user reported experiencing connectivity issues between their Factorio client and the FLE Docker server after a recent Steam update, resulting in immediate desynchronization errors due to mismatched CRC values.
   - Attempts to resolve this included verifying the Factorio client version (**1.1.110**), rebuilding the FLE Docker container, and ensuring the Space Age DLC was disabled, yet the issue persisted, pointing to a FLE-specific problem.
- ****LangGraph Limbo**: Documentation Deficit Hinders Integration!**: A user expressed difficulty connecting their LangGraph agent to FLE, citing limited documentation and uncertainty about the expected communication interface.
   - Despite pointers to agent creation in the */agents* directory and code for attaching new agents in */eval/open/independent_runs/run.py*, the absence of a LangGraph agent example complicated the integration process.

- **HuggingFace Inference vs vLLM Performance is a hot topic**: A user noted that while **vLLM** is faster for generation tasks, **HuggingFace inference** uses less power, yet **HuggingFace inference** can use full power for loglikelihood tasks.
   - Another user replied that this is expected, because *vllm is optimised for fast generation*.
- **lm-eval-harness BOS Token Discussion**: A user reported that the tokenized prompt includes the **BOS token** when running loglikelihood tasks using base models and the `LocalCompletionsAPI` implementation.
   - The user inquired about specifying `add_bos_token=False`.
- **lm-eval-harness sampling discussed**: A user asked if setting `do_sample:true` without specifying `temperature` would use the **Hugging Face** model's `generation_config` settings.
   - The response was that *Need temp > 0. Otherwise it sets do_sample to false*.

> `Unsloth, Claude Sonnet Finetuning, Qwen3-4b comparison, GRPO` 


- **Unsloth Finetunes Claude Sonnet Data**: A member used [Unsloth](https://unsloth.ai/) to finetune their **Claude Sonnet** chat history data, which they downloaded.
   - They use **Claude Sonnet** to *vibe code* dspy a lot.
- **Lora vs Qwen3-4b**: The member provided a side-by-side comparison of their finetuned **Lora** model versus **Qwen3-4b** in a zero-shot setting via a [screenshot](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1202371242519441499/1369394955814047827/Screenshot_from_2025-05-06_11-53-13.png?ex=681d056f&is=681bb3ef&hm=ba16441900eac50074450b4f8e6dcd7993d8e8820da192be4596da94eff4ea6d&).
   - The **Lora** model correctly picked up *def forward*, whereas the non-Lora version skipped it, and the Claude data uses *<antThinking>* instead of *<think>*.
- **GRPO finetune might work better**: The member noted that their **SFT finetune** almost got **LabeledFewShot** correct but hallucinated.
   - They believe a **GRPO** finetune would pick it up easily.

> `Efficient Domain Knowledge Injection in DSPy, DSPy Signature Docstrings, ReAct Module Signature without direct output, Accessing full LLM history` 


- **Brainstorming Knowledge Injection Methods in DSPy**: A member is seeking a more token-efficient way to inject **domain knowledge** (specifically ES cluster indices and mappings) into a DSPy program, rather than including it as an InputField in every prompt, aiming to provide it only once at the session start.
   - While system prompts might work, DSPy's idiomatic approach is preferred; another user suggested including the entire **Postgres schema** in the system prompt for text2SQL tasks.
- **Docstrings as Instructions in DSPy Signatures**: Members discussed using **docstrings in dspy.Signature** to provide essential instructions, treating them as specifications for collaborators regarding the function's intended behavior.
   - The best practice is to **explain *what*** the task is, rather than *how* to achieve it, focusing on non-obvious details from inputs and outputs, and relying on training data when available, but potentially abusing the docstring in *quick and dirty* applications.
- **Docstrings automatically incorporated in System message**: It was revealed that **docstrings make their way as instructions for the system message in the default adapter**.
   - The `dspy.inspect_history()` method was suggested to inspect the LLM's interaction history, but a member pointed out that **llm.inspect_history() truncates fields** and throws serialization errors when attempting to dump to a file.
- **Designing ReAct Module Signature without Direct Output**: A member inquired about creating a signature for a **ReAct module** that primarily outputs tool calls, questioning whether output fields can be left blank if the tool calls are the primary objective.
   - No direct answer was given.

> `GitHub Notebook Rendering Issues, Colab vs GitHub for Notebooks, Missing "State" Key Error` 


- **GitHub rendering botches Notebooks**: A member suggested that **GitHub's notebook rendering** might be too picky, causing a missing "state" key error.
   - The member suggested that the issue could stem from a prematurely copied notebook, lacking a step that creates the **missing "state" key**.
- **Colab steps in to fix Github**: A user suggested that in the future, **linking to the Colab version** ([https://colab.research.google.com/github/Columbia-NLP-Lab/PAPILLON/blob/main/papillon_tutorial.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Columbia-NLP-Lab/PAPILLON/blob/main/papillon_tutorial.ipynb)) instead of the GitHub version would be the quickest fix.
   - They suggested that Colab's rendering is more forgiving of the potentially missing piece.

- **Solving Modular Puzzles Remains Elusive on Apple Silicon**: Members discussed the ability to run **Modular Puzzles** on Macbooks, concluding it's not directly possible on **Apple Silicon GPUs** but can be done remotely on a GPU-attached cloud instance.
   - Supported **NVIDIA GPU architectures** for Mojo GPU programming include **Turing, Ampere, Hopper, and Blackwell** (**RTX 20XX - 50XX series**).
- **Trait Fields Tempt, Properties Please**: Concerns were raised about fields in traits, suggesting that fields in traits *could* happen, but you would be denied the ability to add such a trait via an extension; you would need to include it in the original `struct` definition.
   - It was agreed that *properties in traits is probably a strictly better idea than fields in traits*, because it's more general.
- **Modular Hackathon Happening!**: A final reminder that there is a hackathon coming up, the [Modular Hackathon](https://app.agihouse.org/events/modular-hackathon-20250510) at **AGI House in Hillsborough** on Saturday, with spots still available.

- **Mojo's Pub/Private Syntax**: A member inquired if **Mojo** has a `pub` syntax like **Rust** or defaults to private, and if there's a roadmap to add this feature.
   - A member responded that **Mojo** currently follows the **Python** convention of *"everything is public, prefix things that are supposed to be private with an underscore"*
- **Mimicking Enums in Mojo**: A member requested recommendations for mimicking enums with large sets of enumerable values, asking if a nested `alias` for each unique value is the only way right now.
   - Another member confirmed that this is pretty much the way to do it and [provided an example using aliases](https://discord.com/channels/1090139666822852718/1090139667791775815/1199539474467168346).
- **Open-Source Compiler Contributions**: A member inquired if open-source contributors can currently contribute to the **Mojo** compiler.
   - A member responded that there is not currently a way, but there's a decent chance that sum types will be implemented before the compiler is open for contribution.
- **Compile-Time Abort Capability**: A member asked if it's possible to abort at compile-time to add compile-time guards, sharing a code snippet example.
   - Another member responded that they're not sure if that's possible, but the proposed `requires`-like syntax might fix this though.
- **Mojo Roadmap Revealed**: The Mojo Roadmap has been revealed to the public in the [Modular Forums](https://forum.modular.com/t/whats-next-for-mojo-near-term-roadmap/1395).
   - Members reacted positively and discussed how to test **constrained** tests, or, when we get it `requires` to validate error messages, similar to "assert_raising" but at compile time.
