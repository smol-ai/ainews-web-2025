Kimi has been on an [absolute tear in the past year](http://china%20takes%20another%20huge%20leap%20ahead%20in%20open%20models/), and we last heard from them in November with [Kimi K2 Thinking](https://news.smol.ai/issues?pattern=sota). Like K2, today’s K2.5 is still a 32B active-1T param model (384 experts), “[built through continual pretraining on 15 trillion mixed visual and text tokens atop Kimi-K2-Base”](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/2016027034653164004) (which itself was on 15T tokens), and with an EXTREMELY well produced video from their founder (3 minutes, just watch it):

https://youtu.be/5rithrDqeN8

They again claim SOTA on HLE and BrowseComp ([footnotes](https://www.kimi.com/blog/kimi-k2-5.html#footnotes) give confidence the tests are legit), but also open model SOTA for vision and coding tasks:

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!S5TW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F827f47a5-bf64-47b9-ba34-d67db26c0d16_1072x978.png)

There are a few notables here - Kimi K2.5 is “natively multimodal” for the first time, perhaps [borrowing from Kimi VL](https://x.com/thefirehacker/status/2016223118738764081), but is attributed to “massive-scale vision-text joint pre-training” including VIDEO understanding - “simply upload a screen recording” and K2.5 can reconstruct the website for you:

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8uSV!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6d342ef-ee27-4882-b32c-a2a384301a6b_1782x1954.png)

The fact that this is a **continued pretrain** that changes arch (+400M param [MoonViT](https://x.com/mervenoyann/status/1910767952376328680?s=20) vision encoder) is VERY exciting for model training folks who rarely get to see a scaled up model do stuff like this.

The other 2 headline features are equally exciting: **Agent Swarm** (only for paid users on the Kimi app) which “[learns to self-direct an agent swarm of up to 100 sub-agents, executing parallel workflows across up to 1,500 coordinated steps, without predefined roles or hand-crafted workflows.](https://x.com/eliebakouch/status/2016025747144483060?s=20)” This parallelism results in higher end result performance with up to 4.5x faster speed… ignoring token cost of course.

and “Office Productivity” with **K2.5 Agent** focused on “high-density, large-scale office work end to end”.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yq2_!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb56aea38-12da-46bb-8038-5fbc7143ce0a_1732x1586.png)

This is not empty regurgitation - We saw enough to sign up as a paying subscriber of the Kimi App going forward. As Artificial Analysis [notes](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2016250140219343163/photo/1), the China-Western gap in open models just took another big leap today.

- **Benchmarks/third-party eval framing**: Artificial Analysis positions K2.5 as “leading open weights” and closer to frontier labs, highlighting **GDPval-AA Elo 1309** (agentic knowledge work harness), **MMMU Pro 75%**, **INT4 ~595GB**, and a **64% hallucination rate** (improved vs K2 Thinking) among other stats: [@ArtificialAnlys](https://twitter.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/2016250137115557953). LMArena announcements also place K2.5 Thinking at **#1 open model** in their Text Arena snapshot: [@arena](https://twitter.com/arena/status/2016294722445443470). (Treat leaderboards as *point-in-time*; harness/tooling and prompting matter.)
- **Distribution and “runs at home” signals**: K2.5 landed quickly across infra surfaces: **Ollama cloud** with launch integrations ([@ollama](https://twitter.com/ollama/status/2016086374005538932)), Together AI listing ([@togethercompute](https://twitter.com/togethercompute/status/2016306907015938510)), and Fireworks as a partner ([Moonshot](https://twitter.com/Kimi_Moonshot/status/2016057073000448234)). A notable local-inference datapoint: K2.5 reportedly runs (slowly but “usable”) on **2× M3 Ultra** via MLX with sharded generation, ~**21.9 tok/s** at high memory use: [@awnihannun](https://twitter.com/awnihannun/status/2016221496084205965) (+ command snippet [here](https://twitter.com/awnihannun/status/2016223103081443342)).
- **Product surface area around Kimi**: Moonshot also pushed adjacent tooling: **Kimi Code**, an **Apache-2.0** open-source coding agent integrating with common IDEs/editors ([announcement](https://twitter.com/Kimi_Moonshot/status/2016034259350520226)), and an **Agent SDK** to build custom agents ([link](https://twitter.com/Kimi_Moonshot/status/2016034272998809678)). A “Kimi Product” account is explicitly aimed at distributing prompts/use-cases ([launch](https://twitter.com/Kimi_Moonshot/status/2016082808834531825)), with a viral demo of “**video-to-code**” website cloning ([demo](https://twitter.com/KimiProduct/status/2016081756206846255)).

**Open “American comeback” at scale: Arcee/Prime Intellect Trinity Large Preview (400B MoE)**

- **Trinity Large Preview release**: Arcee dropped **Trinity Large** initial weights as a “preview” release: [@arcee_ai](https://twitter.com/arcee_ai/status/2016278017572495505), with expanded details from [@latkins](https://twitter.com/latkins/status/2016279374287536613). Prime Intellect frames it as an open **400B MoE** with **13B active** trained with Datology data: [@PrimeIntellect](https://twitter.com/PrimeIntellect/status/2016280792037785624). OpenRouter offered limited-time free access: [@OpenRouterAI](https://twitter.com/OpenRouterAI/status/2016280059527757995).
- **Architecture/training details (most concrete technical tweet)**: A strong technical snapshot comes from [@samsja19](https://twitter.com/samsja19/status/2016283855888773277): **400B/A13B MoE**, trained over **17T tokens**; **3:1 interleaved local/global gated attention**, **SWA**, **NoPE on global layers + RoPE on local layers** (as written in tweet), **depth-scaled sandwich norm**, **sigmoid routing**, trained with **Muon**; trained on **~2,000 B300s for a month** on Prime Intellect infra, with data curation by DatologyAI.
- **Data scaling emphasis**: Datology’s involvement is highlighted as a major part of the project: “**6.5T tokens overall**” and “**800B synthetic code**” (plus multilingual curation) in one team member’s recap: [@code_star](https://twitter.com/code_star/status/2016279734985097532). Separate recaps mention **8T synthetic** as part of 17T: [@pratyushmaini](https://twitter.com/pratyushmaini/status/2016287361274138821).
- **Ecosystem readiness**: vLLM announced **day-0 support** for serving Trinity Large: [@vllm_project](https://twitter.com/vllm_project/status/2016322567364346331). The meta-story in the replies is that a Western org is again attempting **frontier-ish pretraining from scratch** with an open model, rather than only post-training/evals.

**Agents everywhere: orchestration, subagents, planning critics, and IDE/CLI integration**

- **Agent “swarm” vs “subagents” convergence**: Kimi’s “Agent Swarm” pitch (dynamic subagent creation) parallels the broader pattern of *central orchestrator + parallel specialists*. The most explicit “starter pattern” articulation is LangChain’s stateless subagent model (parallel execution + minimized context bloat): [@sydneyrunkle](https://twitter.com/sydneyrunkle/status/2016285836581765461). Meanwhile, Kimi’s swarm is framed as trainable orchestration via **Parallel-Agent RL (PARL)** in community summaries ([Zach Mueller](https://twitter.com/TheZachMueller/status/2016183468430860587)).
- **Reliability via “critique before execute”**: Google’s Jules introduced a **Planning Critic**—a second agent that critiques plans pre-execution, claiming a **9.5% drop in task failure rates**: [@julesagent](https://twitter.com/julesagent/status/2016178107019837917). Jules also added “Suggested Tasks” for proactive optimizations: [@julesagent](https://twitter.com/julesagent/status/2016249221846864005).
- **Coding-agent products intensifying**: Mistral shipped **Vibe 2.0** upgrades (subagents, user-defined agents, skills/slash commands, and paid plans): [@mistralvibe](https://twitter.com/mistralvibe/status/2016179799689928986) and [@qtnx_](https://twitter.com/qtnx_/status/2016180364771742047). MiniMax launched an “Agent Desktop” workspace pitched as more polished than Claude Cowork: [@omarsar0](https://twitter.com/omarsar0/status/2016149402923200634) (and MiniMax’s own onboarding automation: [@MiniMax_AI](https://twitter.com/MiniMax_AI/status/2016161539749990844)).
- **IDE infrastructure and retrieval**: Cursor claims semantic search materially improves coding-agent performance and that indexing for large codebases is “orders of magnitude faster”: [@cursor_ai](https://twitter.com/cursor_ai/status/2016202243499073768). VS Code continues tightening agent UX (e.g., safer command execution explanations): [@aerezk](https://twitter.com/aerezk/status/2016225215802397146), plus MCP servers returning UI via MCP Apps spec (LIFX control panel example): [@burkeholland](https://twitter.com/burkeholland/status/2016208751200457088).

**Document AI & multimodal systems: DeepSeek-OCR 2 and “Agentic Vision”**

- **DeepSeek-OCR 2: learned reading order + token compression**: DeepSeek-OCR 2 is framed as a shift from fixed raster scans to learned **Visual Causal Flow** with **DeepEncoder V2**, including **16× visual token compression (256–1120 tokens/image)** and **91.09% OmniDocBench v1.5 (+3.73%)**; vLLM shipped day-0 support: [@vllm_project](https://twitter.com/vllm_project/status/2016065526058090967). Unsloth notes similar headline improvements: [@danielhanchen](https://twitter.com/danielhanchen/status/2016043326760485313).
- **Mechanistic intuition (why it matters for pipelines)**: Jerry Liu provides a clear “why learned order helps” explanation: avoid semantically shredding tables/forms by allowing query tokens to attend to contiguous regions instead of strict left-to-right: [@jerryjliu0](https://twitter.com/jerryjliu0/status/2016319238974407146). Teortaxes adds a pragmatic eval take: OCR 2 is “on par with dots.ocr” and “nowhere near SOTA,” but the ideas may influence later multimodal products: [@teortaxesTex](https://twitter.com/teortaxesTex/status/2016179572056678739).
- **Gemini “Agentic Vision” = vision + code execution loop**: Google is productizing a “Think, Act, Observe” loop where the model writes/executes Python to crop/zoom/annotate images, claiming **5–10% quality boosts** across many vision benchmarks: [@_philschmid](https://twitter.com/_philschmid/status/2016225242394296773) and the official thread: [@GoogleAI](https://twitter.com/GoogleAI/status/2016267526330601720). This is an explicit move toward *tool-augmented vision* being first-class, not bolted on.

**AI for science & research workflows: OpenAI Prism as “Overleaf with AI”**

- **Prism launch**: OpenAI introduced **Prism**, a free “AI-native workspace for scientists” powered by **GPT-5.2**, positioned as a unified LaTeX collaboration environment: [@OpenAI](https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/2016209462621831448) and [@kevinweil](https://twitter.com/kevinweil/status/2016210486778642808). Community summaries frame it as “Overleaf with AI” (proofreading, citations, literature search): [@scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/2016211218633990391).
- **Data/IP clarification**: Kevin Weil clarified that Prism follows your ChatGPT data controls and that OpenAI is not taking a share of individual discoveries; any IP-alignment deals would be bespoke for large orgs: [@kevinweil](https://twitter.com/kevinweil/status/2016285175106420867).
- **Why it matters technically**: Prism is a product bet that **collaboration context + tool integration** (LaTeX, citations, project state) becomes a durable advantage—mirroring the “context > intelligence” theme circulating in Chinese discussions about OpenAI infra and org design: [@ZhihuFrontier](https://twitter.com/ZhihuFrontier/status/2016068402457285032).

**Research notes & benchmarks worth tracking (RL, planning, multilingual scaling)**

- **Long-horizon planning benchmark**: *DeepPlanning* proposes verifiable-constraint planning tasks (multi-day travel, shopping) and reports frontier agents still struggle; emphasizes explicit reasoning patterns and parallel tool use: [@iScienceLuvr](https://twitter.com/iScienceLuvr/status/2016122154862182792). (This pairs nicely with the “travel planning again” meme: [@teortaxesTex](https://twitter.com/teortaxesTex/status/2016043107607879864).)
- **RL efficiency and reuse of traces**: *PrefixRL* idea—condition on off-policy prefixes to speed RL on hard reasoning, claiming **2× faster** to same reward vs strong baseline: [@iScienceLuvr](https://twitter.com/iScienceLuvr/status/2016125085825040852).
- **Multilingual scaling laws**: Google Research announced **ATLAS** scaling laws for massively multilingual LMs with data-driven guidance on balancing data mix vs model size: [@GoogleResearch](https://twitter.com/GoogleResearch/status/2016234343602258274).
- **Math research reality check**: Epoch’s **FrontierMath: Open Problems** benchmark invites attempts; “AI hasn’t solved any of these yet”: [@EpochAIResearch](https://twitter.com/EpochAIResearch/status/2016188014540816879).

   - They are looking for a way to register only a fast forward and first derivative, and then have autograd handle arbitrarily higher derivatives.
- **Seeking Torch-Native Autograd Solution**: The member is seeking the most **Torch-native** way to allow **autograd** to fulfill requests for arbitrarily higher derivatives, even if the process is slow.
   - They want to avoid writing custom backward implementations for all possible scenarios and rely on **autograd** for higher-order differentiation.
- **SpecializedModule forward pass**: The code is constructing a custom `forward` pass for a `SpecializedModule`.
   - It utilizes a `custom_op` to perform a simple addition operation `x + num` where num is an attribute of the module.  It leverages `register_cpp_extension_helper` to accomplish this task.

> `Container Issue, SYS_PTRACE, devcontainer.json` 


- ****Container Configuration Cures Confinement Crisis****: A member resolved a **container issue** by adding `--cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --security-opt seccomp=unconfined` when running the container.
   - Alternatively, users can add `runArgs` to `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` with the same parameters to achieve the same effect.
- ****Security Opts Solve Mysterious Container Conundrums****: The user reported resolution by adding `--security-opt seccomp=unconfined`.
   - This disables seccomp, potentially resolving issues related to system call restrictions within the container.
