<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->> AI News for 3/26/2024-3/27/2024. We checked 5 subreddits and [**364** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and 24 Discords (374 channels, and 4858 messages) for you (we added Modular and Tinygrad today). Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): 538 minutes.

There's a LOT to like about Databricks Mosaic's new model ([Corporate blog](https://www.databricks.com/blog/introducing-dbrx-new-state-art-open-llm?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email), [team blog](https://www.databricks.com/blog/announcing-dbrx-new-standard-efficient-open-source-customizable-llms?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email), [free HF space demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/databricks/dbrx-instruct?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email), [GitHub](https://github.com/databricks/dbrx?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email), [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39838104&utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email), [Jon Frankle tweet](https://x.com/jefrankle/status/1772961586497425683?s=46&t=90xQ8sGy63D2OtiaoGJuww&utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email), [Vitaliy Chiley tweet](https://x.com/vitaliychiley/status/1772958872891752868?s=46&t=6FDPaNxZcbSsELal6Sv7Ug), [Wired puff piece](https://www.wired.com/story/dbrx-inside-the-creation-of-the-worlds-most-powerful-open-source-ai-model/?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email), [terrible horrible no good very bad Techcrunch take](https://x.com/migtissera/status/1773030280539865495?s=20&utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email), [Daniel Han arch review](https://x.com/danielhanchen/status/1772981050530316467?s=46&t=6FDPaNxZcbSsELal6Sv7Ug&utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email), [Qwen lead response](https://twitter.com/JustinLin610/status/1773037453101924675)):

- It beats Grok and Mixtral and LLama2 on evals (all of which beat GPT3.5 for breakfast), and is about 2x more efficient than Llama2 and Grok
- It's **[about $10m](https://twitter.com/migtissera/status/1773063735550022094?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email)** worth of compute released as (kinda) open weights, trained in 2 months on 3k H100's.
- It's trained on **[12 trillion](https://x.com/Teknium1/status/1772963762485571666?s=20&utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email)** (undisclosed) tokens (most open models stop at 2-2.5T, but of course **[Redpajama 2 offers up to 30T](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/17om8xf/redpajamadatav2_is_incredible/?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email)**)
- This new dataset + the new choice of adopting OpenAI's 100k tiktoken tokenizer (recognizing 3 digit numbers properly and adopting native ChatML format) was [at least 2x better token-for-token than MPT-7B's data](https://www.databricks.com/blog/introducing-dbrx-new-state-art-open-llm).
- It is **[surprisingly](https://twitter.com/jefrankle/status/1772961617728197056?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email)** good at code (**[beat GPT4 at 0 shot, pass@1 humaneval](https://x.com/dylan522p/status/1772972997990580381?s=20&utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email)**)

All is truly great but you *also* have to be really good at reading between the lines to find what we're *not* saying above... 

…or just read the right discords:

![https://assets.buttondown.email/images/c9622806-2c2c-42b6-8629-b0178e19ff27.png?w=960&fit=max](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/c9622806-2c2c-42b6-8629-b0178e19ff27.png?w=960&fit=max)

In other words, a new MoE model trained on >12x the data and +50% the experts (and having +70% the param count per expert - 12 choose 4 of 12B experts vs 8 choose 2 of 7B experts) of Mixtral is somehow *only* 1% better than Mixtral on MMLU (however it is indeed great on coding). Weird, no? As Qwen's tech lead [says](https://twitter.com/JustinLin610/status/1773037453101924675):

> "If it acativates 36B params, the model's perf should be equivalent to a 72B dense model or even 80B. In consideration of training on 12T tokens, I think it has the potential to be much better. 78 or higher for MMLU is what I expect."

Like **[Dolly](https://www.latent.space/p/mike-conover?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email)** and **[MPT](https://www.latent.space/p/mosaic-mpt-7b?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email)** before it, the main focus is more that "you can train models with us" than it is about really going after **[Mistral's open source crown](https://www.latent.space/p/oct-2023?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email)**:

> "Our customers will find that training MoEs is also about 2x more FLOP-efficient than training dense models for the same final model quality. End-to-end, our overall recipe for DBRX (including the pretraining data, model architecture, and optimization strategy) can match the quality of our previous-generation MPT models with nearly 4x less compute."

Mosaic is already talking up the recent Lilac acquisition as a part of the story:

- **Quest for Learning NLP**: A member sought recommendations for learning NLP, and another member responded with a link to Hugging Face's [learning resources](https://huggingface.co/learn), which include courses on NLP, Deep RL, Audio, an AI Cookbook, and ML for Games.
- **Concerns About LLM Download Times**: A user experienced more than 8 hours of download time for the Mistral 7B model through LM Studio on Ubuntu 22.04. The process seemed unusually slow but eventually completed, leading to a discussion on whether high CPU usage percentages over 100% are viable or indicative of an issue.
- **Misleading Model Capabilities**: In a discussion about language model capabilities, it was noted that models like CodeLlama do not actually access emails or Git but may generate affirmative, potentially misleading responses. Users are advised to rely on documentation rather than the model-generated assertions about capabilities.
- **Deciphering LLMs on MacBook GPUs**: Members exchanged insights about running large language models (LLMs) like Mistral and Llama on local devices, such as a MacBook with M1 chip, using tools like llama.cpp and Ollama, which can utilize shared memory architecture for efficient operation.
- **TensorRT-LLM vs Other Frameworks for GPU Performance**: In a discussion about using AWS SageMaker for running LLM inference with different frameworks, a user mentioned alternatives such as Runpod, Vast AI, and Kaggle may offer more flexibility and lower cost compared to AWS, but AWS might provide better reliability. There's also mention of the need to potentially build a custom image for AWS SageMaker if specific frameworks like VLLM are required.

- **AttributeError in RAPTOR PACK**: A user faced an `AttributeError` concerning the `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'context_window'` while working with **RAPTOR PACK**. This error was discussed in the context of different imports from **Langchain** and **Llamaindex** and whether there was an alternative way to address the issue without making production changes.
- **Embedding API Response Issues**: There was a conversation about a custom **Embedding API** returning a `ValidationError` when attempting to embed documents using RAPTOR pack. Issues with the embedding function type and troubleshooting steps, like ensuring the response from the embedding API is as expected, were discussed.
- **Custom LLM Class Challenges**: The dialogue included a discussion about an AttributeError problem arising due to potential import conflicts between Langchain and LlamaIndex packages. Users shared code and suggested potential adjustments to resolve these issues, including wrapping the Langchain imported LLM to use it with LlamaIndex's RAPTOR pack.
- **PDF Chunking for Embeddings**: A user inquired about strategies for processing PDFs to generate long-context text chunks suitable for embeddings. There was a recommendation to manually combine smaller chunks into larger ones despite the default behavior of the PDF splitter to do single-page splits.
- **IngestionPipeline Query Concern**: Queries about the IngestionPipeline were raised particularly when using multiple transformations like **MarkdownNodeParser** and **SentenceSplitter** that seemed to interfere with the preservation of the original document's ID in the vector store post embedding. There was a suggestion to ensure consistent document IDs are used across input documents to facilitate deduplication.
