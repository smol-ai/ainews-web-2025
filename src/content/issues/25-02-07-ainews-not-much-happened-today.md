> `Image Classifiers and Concept Erasure, Skip Transcoders vs Sparse Autoencoders, Quadratic Feature Removal Methods` 


- **Image Classifiers learn faster when erasing features**: Research shows that erasing simple features from training data can sometimes accelerate learning in image classifiers, rather than hinder it. The method, LELeast-Squares Concept Erasure (LEACE), consistently complicates learning for various classifier architectures.
   - In contrast, quadratic erasure methods exhibited mixed results, prompting a recommendation for caution when applying these techniques in practice.
- **Skip Transcoders outperform Sparse Autoencoders**: Introduction of **skip transcoders** demonstrates improvements in interpretability and model fidelity over Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). By utilizing a sparse bottleneck and a linear skip connection, they enhance expressivity without compromising interpretability.
   - In related work, despite efforts using skip transcoders to rewrite parts of transformers, outcomes fell short of expectations, establishing a need for ongoing enhancements.
- **Complexities in Quadratic Feature Removal**: The study discusses two methods for removing quadratic features, QLEACE and ALF-QLEACE, which yield different effects on model performance. Notably, QLEACE's dependence on true class labels resulted in unintended consequences when applied.
