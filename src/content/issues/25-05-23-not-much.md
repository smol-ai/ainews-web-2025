# AI Reddit Recap

## /r/LocalLlama Recap

### 1. User Hardware Setups for Large-Scale LLM Inference

- [**96GB VRAM! What should run first?**](https://i.redd.it/co0zhh06sj2f1.jpeg) ([Score: 831, Comments: 264](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ktlz3w/96gb_vram_what_should_run_first/)): **The post showcases an NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada Generation GPU with 96GB VRAM, a flagship workstation-class graphics card designed for high-end AI, ML, and data science workloads. The user mentions supply chain hurdles requiring a fake company domain to purchase, underlining the card's exclusivity to enterprise buyers. The card's massive VRAM makes it ideal for large language models (LLMs), advanced rendering, and extensive GPU compute tasks. [Image here.](https://i.redd.it/co0zhh06sj2f1.jpeg)** A top comment suggests testing current LLMs (like Qwen2.5 3B with large context windows) to assess card performance and memory utilization, highlighting community interest in real-world AI workloads.
    - One user suggests testing Qwen2.5 3B with a 2k context window on the 96GB VRAM setup as an initial experiment to evaluate performance and memory usage, specifically monitoring if it overloads the card.
    - A detailed technical suggestion recommends running the Qwen3 235B model using its Q3_K_M quantized GGUF version (~112GB), linking directly to the [HuggingFace repository](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3-235B-A22B-GGUF/tree/main/Q3_K_M). They note with sufficient VRAM or multiple GPUs, the model can be sharded and run with only 65-70 MoEs, yielding estimated performance of 30-50 tokens/sec and about 70% of full model 'brain power'.
    - Further technical advice includes running the IQ4 quantization of Qwen3 235B (via [IQ4_XS GGUF version](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3-235B-A22B-GGUF/tree/main/IQ4_XS), approx. 125GB), potentially with a 3090 or 4090 GPU. This approach could bring model efficacy to 'mid 80%' of the original, with performance projections of at least 25 tokens/sec on a dual-GPU setup if not all MoEs are kept active.
- [**I accidentally too many P100**](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ktiq99) ([Score: 318, Comments: 62](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ktiq99/i_accidentally_too_many_p100/)): **The OP reports building a workstation using 16 Nvidia P100 GPUs (PCIe) in an Intel S2600CW (dual 8-core Xeons, circa 2014), achieving functional but limited PCIe bandwidth (**`2@4x`**) and low CPU throughput. Their target was to run large-context LLMs (Llama 4, Qwen3-235B), but performance using llama.cpp was suboptimal and vllm-pascal (using the container from ghcr.io/sasha0552/vllm:latest) failed to run Qwen3-235B. The user requests advice for improving Qwen3-235B parallelism and is open to benchmarking other models. Top technical comment notes llama.cpp can only leverage fp32/fp16 but recommends switching to exllama for inference, which is optimized for fp16 and can deliver ~700GB/s bandwidth on such GPUs.** Discussions focus on power requirements and inefficiency of the setup, plus a substantive suggestion to use exllama over llama.cpp for significantly improved fp16 inference throughput on legacy Pascal GPUs (P100) due to memory bandwidth optimization.
    - A commenter notes that running P100 GPUs with exllama rather than llama.cpp is preferable since exllama supports fp16 computation, leveraging the P100’s architecture better. Specifically, exllama can achieve approximately `700 GB/s` bandwidth, significantly improving throughput on these GPUs.
    - Detailed advice is provided for running large models like Qwen3-256B at 4-bit quantization: with `256 GB` memory, tensor-parallel 16 is suggested, though users should ensure the model’s attention heads/layers are divisible by 16 to avoid incompatibility. The user also recommends pre-downloading models and using custom mount paths to avoid losing models on container shutdown, and points to vllm scripts for pre-sharding to speed up startup.
    - The distribution of layers across multiple P100s is discussed, with mention of tools like Koboldcpp and LM Studio, which support such parallelization. A specific technical finding is shared: on P100s, row-split improves token generation (TG) speed but reduces predictive performance (PP), revealing a key trade-off in multi-GPU setups.

### 2. Speech and Audio Interfacing with LLMs: Kyutai Unmute Demo

- [**Unmute by Kyutai: Make LLMs listen and speak**](https://kyutai.org/2025/05/22/unmute.html) ([Score: 113, Comments: 34](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ktklo5/unmute_by_kyutai_make_llms_listen_and_speak/)): **Kyutai's forthcoming open-source project, Unmute (see [official blog](https://kyutai.org/2025/05/22/unmute.html)), integrates real-time, low-latency speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) modules with any LLM to enable two-way voice-based interaction. The demo utilizes Gemma 3 12B as a base and features modular streaming TTS (using a ~2B parameter model) and STT (~1B parameter, with 300M variant planned), running in bfloat16 with memory use of ~4GB (TTS) and ~2GB (STT); batch inference allows massive scaling (e.g., 384 users per H100 for STT), but quantization is yet to be optimized. The architecture supports bidirectional streaming, semantic VAD for improved turn-taking, rapid voice cloning, and interoperability with LLM features, positioning it as a customizable and interruptible alternative to proprietary offerings like CSM and Sesame.** Notable technical commentary lauds the low-latency, streaming nature, bidirectional architecture, and openness relative to competitors, but skepticism remains until open-source code and full benchmarks are public; some suggest further training could improve quality to rival leading closed models.
    - A Kyutai developer shared technical details: the online demo uses a ~2B TTS model and a 1B STT model, with a 300M STT variant also considered for open-sourcing. The models currently run in bfloat16, requiring ~4GB and ~2GB of memory respectively, and quantization has not yet been attempted. Their system supports a large batch size—enabling 384 simultaneous users on a single H100 for STT—resulting in higher overall memory usage but efficient GPU utilization.
    - Discussion highlights that while current demo quality isn't yet comparable to models like CSM, Kyutai's architecture supports bidirectional streaming and very low latency. The expectation is that with further training, performance could improve significantly, especially due to the model's design and low-latency streaming capabilities.
    - A user inquires about the potential for Kyutai's LLM to support an OpenAI-compatible API, allowing users to run STT and TTS components locally while integrating with the LLM, suggesting strong interest in open, modular deployment options.
- [**AGI Coming Soon... after we master 2nd grade math**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1kt7whv/agi_coming_soon_after_we_master_2nd_grade_math/) ([Score: 143, Comments: 93](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1kt7whv/agi_coming_soon_after_we_master_2nd_grade_math/)): **A user highlights the persistent failure of state-of-the-art LLMs (specifically Claude 4 Sonnet) to solve simple arithmetic problems (e.g., '9.9 - 9.11'), suggesting a gap between LLM benchmarks and true reasoning capability. The attached screenshot ([image link](https://preview.redd.it/pe2eeljssf2f1.png?width=580&format=png&auto=webp&s=f881b7ce4409013458c17fff08e8377a329cb9df)) demonstrates the model's incorrect handling of basic math. This problem indicates that even advanced models may still lack robust numeracy and logical consistency in elementary domains, raising questions about AGI timelines constrained by such foundational errors.** Several comments point out persistent arithmetic and logical failures across models, with one referencing **Dario Amodei's (Anthropic)** tongue-in-cheek claim of 'catastrophic misuse potential' for future versions. Another comment satirizes agent hype in LLMs by referencing comically long-running session times with no evident improvement in elementary reasoning.
    - Discussion highlights persistent failures of advanced language models like Claude 3 Opus and Anthropic's models in simple arithmetic tasks, illustrated by screenshots showing their incorrect answers to basic math like "7 + 4". Users note how these errors persist even in state-of-the-art models labeled as high autonomy/risk ("ASL-5") for other capabilities.
    - One commenter compares model competency directly, observing that Qwen3 32B, a large model from Alibaba, consistently and correctly handles these arithmetic queries, suggesting a gap between some Western flagship models and alternatives in basic numeracy.
    - Several posts underscore that even top-tier models (e.g., "Opus") fail elementary math reliably, casting doubt on hype about imminent artificial general intelligence (AGI) and highlighting a disconnect between narrative risk assessments and actual performance on simple tasks.

### 1. Veo 3 and AI Text-to-Video Model Use Cases & Community Experiments

- [**Veo 3 can generate gameplay videos**](https://v.redd.it/fnxrnc2nkk2f1) ([Score: 1659, Comments: 269](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1ktpxn9/veo_3_can_generate_gameplay_videos/)): **The post claims that the Veo 3 model can now generate gameplay videos, suggesting a significant advance in AI-driven video synthesis. No technical benchmarks or implementation details are provided in the post itself, and access to the referenced video is restricted (HTTP 403), so the fidelity, prompts, or architecture details of Veo 3 remain unspecified.** Top comments highlight the potential for Veo 3 to disrupt game development pipelines and advertising industries, with one commenter asserting that it 'mops the floor' with existing competitors, implying a significant qualitative leap over current state-of-the-art text-to-video models.
    - Veo 3 is described as significantly outperforming current competitors in video generation quality, suggesting a notable leap in model capability and fidelity for tasks like synthetic gameplay footage generation. This highlights Veo 3's advanced generative modeling, indicating marked improvement over previous video synthesis models.
- [**Giving People Existential Crises With VEO 3**](https://v.redd.it/rsolq3gqph2f1) ([Score: 186, Comments: 25](https://www.reddit.com/r/aivideo/comments/1kte90l/giving_people_existential_crises_with_veo_3/)): **The post discusses common output patterns and quirks observed in videos generated using OpenAI's VEO 3 model, particularly focusing on animation tropes such as 'AI stares'—where characters freeze with intense, wide-open eyes—and repetitive visual motifs like t-shirt tears in similar locations. Commenters note a lack of original scripting in user-generated prompt videos and highlight the dramatic improvement in generative video model quality over the past two years.** Some users criticize the lack of creativity in prompt scripting, stating that many videos follow identical, meta-referential formats. Others emphasize the significance of rapid technological progress, suggesting that increasing sophistication justifies continued showcase, even if underlying prompt diversity is lacking.
    - Multiple commenters discuss noticeable generation artifacts and tropes in VEO 3 outputs, such as 'AI stares'—characters freezing with unnaturally wide eyes when conveying intensity—and repeated visual motifs (e.g., consistent placement of tears in t-shirts). These artifacts signal synthetic origins and reduce realism.
    - There is criticism of the repetitive nature of VEO 3 video prompts and scripting styles, often defaulting to meta-commentary like 'We're AI, this is a prompt.' This lack of diversity in storytelling and prompt design may limit broader adoption or more convincing use cases.
    - Commenters note the rapid progress of AI video generation capabilities over the past two years but also point out that persistent visual cues, especially around eye rendering, still reveal the artificial nature of generated clips, highlighting a current technical limitation.
- [**Pushing Veo 3 to the limit...**](https://v.redd.it/b0wi5z39ii2f1) ([Score: 479, Comments: 79](https://www.reddit.com/r/aivideo/comments/1ktgjwh/pushing_veo_3_to_the_limit/)): **The post discusses experimentation with Veo 3, a generative video AI model. Key technical limitations noted include the lack of image-to-video capability, leading to poor control over visual consistency (e.g., outfit or background continuity) and reliance solely on prompt engineering for generation. Commenters anticipate rapid quality improvements over the coming year.** Top comments highlight both excitement at the direction of Veo 3 and frustration with its missing features (notably, no image input). There is an expectation that future versions will significantly improve output cleanliness and creative control, assuming added conditioning mechanisms or input modalities.
    - AwardHappy9673 notes a key limitation of Veo 3: the lack of image-to-video functionality severely restricts user control and makes it difficult to enforce visual consistency (such as outfits or backgrounds) across generated clips. Without the ability to feed in reference images, achieving specific or narrative-consistent results requires unwieldy prompt engineering and is still unreliable.
- [**'The Department of Human Captcha' made with Veo3**](https://v.redd.it/22imwvlcrj2f1) ([Score: 167, Comments: 19](https://www.reddit.com/r/aivideo/comments/1ktlvof/the_department_of_human_captcha_made_with_veo3/)): **The post details hands-on experimentation with Google's Veo3 text-to-video model, emphasizing its capability to generate highly realistic, narratively coherent video sequences, though the user highlights its substantial cost, unreliability, and a notably buggy interface—the scene editor is described as barely functional. Only text-to-video is supported currently, constraining complex editing workflows, but the user reports best results using a vignette-style format with heavy prompt iteration. Observations include Veo3's sophisticated handling of lip-sync, voice generation, and matching of vocal characteristics to character visuals.** Commenters are technically impressed by how the generated voices and sound effects closely match the apparent personalities of the on-screen figures, emphasizing the realism and alignment of audio with video. There are few criticisms in the comments, with the main debates centering on the surprising accuracy of voice-to-visual pairing rather than technical flaws.
    - There is technical discussion about Veo 3's capability to match generated voices with character visuals, with multiple users noting how the AI convincingly produces voices that *fit* the appearance of specific characters in the video, suggesting advanced multimodal modeling for audiovisual coherence.
    - One commenter inquires about the practical workflow and resource usage: they specifically ask for metrics like *hours spent* generating the video, and *word count* of the prompt, seeking insight into Veo 3's usability and efficiency for content creators.
    - A question is raised about Veo 3's support for non-English languages, specifically whether it can *generate dialogue in Portuguese*, pointing to interest in the model's multilingual generative capabilities and speech synthesis flexibility.
- [**Damn you aliens!

Without access to the video, the post's technical context, model details, or implementation data cannot be determined from the provided information.** Top comments reflect non-technical, subjective reactions—there is no substantive technical debate or opinion regarding Veo3 Flow's implementation or capabilities.
    - A user raises cost-to-output concerns, asking specifically: *'How many renders does the $250 a month get you?'* This points to practical questions around Veo3 Flow's value proposition and potential limitations in pricing models for high-demand or professional users. Others express general enthusiasm for the technology but seek more detail on rendering quotas and usage caps for premium tiers.
- [**Interstellar TV (Episode 2)**](https://v.redd.it/vk4ymmrd3g2f1) ([Score: 128, Comments: 13](https://www.reddit.com/r/aivideo/comments/1kt91d6/interstellar_tv_episode_2/)): **The poster has released Episode 2 of their 'Interstellar TV' series composed of video shorts, created using Kling and Veo3—likely referencing the AI video generation models from Kling AI and Google (Veo3). The YouTube link to the episode is provided. No deep technical discussion or implementation details about model choice, prompt engineering, or workflow are included in the post.** Top comments do not present substantive technical discussion, focusing instead on humor and general reactions.
    - The comment referencing 'Interdimensional Cable Morty' draws a technical parallel between the format of 'Interstellar TV (Episode 2)' and the well-known 'Interdimensional Cable' episodes from Rick and Morty, which are characterized by randomized, often procedurally generated or improv-style sketch content. This highlights a core production technique for both series, emphasizing the use of surreal, unscripted television segments as a storytelling device.

### 2. Isomorphic Labs & AlphaFold: Rapid AI-driven Drug Discovery Progress

- [**Demis Hassabis says he wants to reduce drug discovery from 10 years to weeks - AlphaFold - Isomorphic Labs**](https://v.redd.it/psnvrhqoli2f1) ([Score: 532, Comments: 84](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1ktgxpx/demis_hassabis_says_he_wants_to_reduce_drug/)): **Demis Hassabis (DeepMind/Isomorphic Labs) discusses ambitions to reduce drug discovery timelines from the traditional** `10 years` **to mere** `weeks` **using AI, leveraging advances initiated by models like AlphaFold ([YouTube interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe2adi-OWV0)). AlphaFold predicts protein structures with high accuracy, enabling more rapid in silico hypothesis generation for target validation and drug design, potentially accelerating preclinical R&D and compound screening cycles.** Top comments emphasize that progress in domain-specific AI (like AlphaFold) is already shifting pharmaceutical research prior to the arrival of generalized AGI, suggesting that substantial acceleration in biotech/longevity could materialize through such narrow AI well before full AGI is realized.
    - Discussion highlights that AlphaFold and Isomorphic Labs leverage narrow AI to significantly accelerate biomedical research—specifically in protein folding and drug discovery—potentially reducing timelines from `10 years` to *weeks*, according to Demis Hassabis. This represents a substantial technical leap before the availability of AGI and offers a near-term, practical impact from current AI advancements.
    - A personal anecdote about lymphedema illustrates the gap between incremental progress in biomedical interventions and the transformative potential of AI-driven approaches (such as bio-printing, advanced gene therapy, or pharmaceutical discovery). The comment reflects hope that with AI advances seen in models like AlphaFold, solutions for difficult diseases could become feasible within `5 years`.
- [**AI-developed drug will be in trials by year-end, says Google’s Hassabis**](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1ktf6ou/aideveloped_drug_will_be_in_trials_by_yearend/) ([Score: 461, Comments: 68](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1ktf6ou/aideveloped_drug_will_be_in_trials_by_yearend/)): **Isomorphic Labs, a subsidiary of Alphabet, is projecting that its AI-driven drug discovery platform will yield its first candidate in human trials (in oncology, cardiovascular, or neurodegeneration) by end of 2024, per founder Demis Hassabis. Hassabis claims their approach could accelerate typical drug discovery timelines by up to 10x compared to the industry average (which is traditionally 5-10 years per drug) [Financial Times source](https://www.ft.com/content/41b51d07-0754-4ffd-a8f9-737e1b1f0c2e). The technical premise centers on using AI for target identification, molecular design, and narrowing down successful candidates faster than current wet-lab-heavy preclinical approaches.** Comments debate the broad claim that AI could enable solving 'all diseases' rapidly, but technically focus on the value of AI in triaging drug candidates and its potential impact on R&D throughput. Some also speculate on the wider socioeconomic effects of such acceleration, including potential indirect benefits like poverty reduction and productivity gains, but note technical and practical limits.
    - The most notable technical impact of AI in drug development, according to discussion, is its application as a filter in the drug discovery pipeline: AI can efficiently eliminate compounds likely to fail, thereby increasing the proportion of potential 'winners' proceeding to clinical trials. This reduces costs and refines focus, though not every candidate will succeed.
    - One commenter noted that despite AI accelerating early-stage stages, the clinical trial phase itself remains a significant bottleneck—AI does not inherently speed up formal regulatory testing. As an example, a startup can get a drug into trials in about 4-5 years, which is not much different from the traditional process, implying AI's impact may currently be most pronounced in discovery, not clinical validation or approval timelines.

### 3. Anthropic Claude Opus 4 Launch: User Impressions, Pricing, and Creative Impact

- [**It’s been less than 3 years since ChatGPT appeared and LLMs are already too good to notice incremental improvement**](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1kt3bxm/its_been_less_than_3_years_since_chatgpt_appeared/) ([Score: 289, Comments: 72](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1kt3bxm/its_been_less_than_3_years_since_chatgpt_appeared/)): **The post observes that with the introduction of new frontier LLMs (e.g., Claude Opus 4), incremental qualitative improvements are now largely imperceptible to users in everyday interactions, necessitating reliance on standardized benchmarks for evaluation. The author compares this to earlier model cycles (e.g., GPT-3), where leaps in capability were immediately noticeable, noting that while absolute improvements remain significant, improvements are now analogous to hardware generational shifts: present but low perceivability for average users unless engaged in edge cases or high-difficulty tasks.** Comments emphasize that LLM advancements become apparent primarily in more complex tasks, akin to distinguishing expertise in demanding scenarios rather than basic ones. Another thread highlights that core issues—hallucination, context length, and learning limitations—persist across models, tempering perceived progress despite measurable gains.
    - Progress in LLMs is becoming less perceptible in standard or basic tasks, as current models already match or surpass competent human performance on these; meaningful distinctions now tend to emerge only in highly complex or edge-case scenarios where state-of-the-art capabilities are actively stress-tested.
    - A recurring technical limitation remains: despite quality gains, LLMs still exhibit persistent issues such as hallucination, lack of real-time online learning, and restricted context windows. These unsolved constraints reduce the practical significance of incremental improvements for many use cases.
    - Some discussion revolves around whether LLM development is hitting a performance plateau, with recent model releases showing diminishing returns in overall qualitative leaps unless scrutinized in very advanced or narrow use cases.
- [**Claude Opus 4 just cost me $7.60 for ONE task on Windsurf**](https://i.redd.it/zxecobohai2f1.jpeg) ([Score: 324, Comments: 134](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1ktfuyv/claude_opus_4_just_cost_me_760_for_one_task_on/)): **The provided image is a screenshot from an API key management page (likely from Anthropic) highlighting a cost of $7.31 associated with a single Windsurf usage instance of Claude Opus 4. The post details how Windsurf adopts a BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) approach, with the user incurring direct per-task expenses ($7.31 for one Claude Opus 4 request) in addition to a $15/month Windsurf fee. This illustrates the high operational cost of leveraging state-of-the-art LLMs for coding via third-party tools, as frequent use could lead to monthly expenses exceeding $2k, making top-tier AI coding assistance potentially unaffordable for individuals or small teams.** Commenters note that for $7.60, getting a feature implemented is arguably cheap compared to enterprise development costs, but also highlight that Opus 4's costs are much steeper than alternatives like Claude Sonnet (roughly 5x more expensive). Others point out that third-party dev tool integrations are inherently less cost-effective and suggest direct subscription methods for better pricing. Discussion also touches on the socioeconomic divide that could emerge if top-tier AI assistance remains costly.
    - One discussion detailed the cost disparity between using Claude Opus versus other Anthropic models, with Opus reportedly being "about x5 more expensive" than Sonnet. Additionally, the stack involving Windsurf (a third-party tool connecting to Claude's APIs) introduces higher costs, as such intermediaries generally lack cost controls and add their own markup, paralleling earlier trends seen with tools like Roo Code and Cline.
    - A technically-minded suggestion indicated that cost efficiency is best achieved via direct subscription to Anthropic's Claude Max tier ($100 minimum) instead of relying on third-party platforms. Direct API access reduces overhead and allows for bulk consumption rates, as opposed to per-task or markup-heavy third-party usage.
    - A broader perspective emerged about overall market trends: subscription models like those for Claude Max ($100/200$ tiers) and similar tools (e.g., Cursor) are becoming standard, effectively moving past the era of affordable $20 subscriptions. This suggests a significant shift in access and cost structure for advanced LLM services.

- **Open WebUI Challenges LM Studio**: Users discuss the possibility of using [Open WebUI](https://github.com/Open-WebUI/Open-WebUI) as a front-end for **LM Studio**, and one user has already integrated it.
   - It can be used purely as a front-end, but users are running into shared memory issues that are slowing down inferencing speeds when using larger models.
- **Browser CORS Settings Thwart LM Studio Connections**: Users are facing **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** issues when trying to access **LM Studio** from a browser, especially when the HTML is hosted on a separate server.
   - The **CORS** option in **LM Studio** needs to be enabled for browser access, including access from the local LAN. HTTPS to HTTP connections may also cause issues.
- **LLMs Flunk Math Test**: A user tested several **LLMs** with a set of **273 floating-point numbers** and found varying degrees of inaccuracy, with [Claude Sonnet 4](https://claude.ai/share/0eaf825c-e0bf-4081-826a-b63f3676fd2c) being the only one to deliver the correct result on the first try.
   - Users debated whether it is fair to judge **LLMs** based on their calculation abilities, as they are primarily token generators and not designed to be calculators. *But intelligent is very vague and doesn't necessarily mean being able to add floats together, or my phone would be intelligent.*
- **Tool Calling for Precise Calculations**: Users discuss the use of **tool calling** to enable **LLMs** to perform accurate calculations, where the LLM can make calls to external tools or code to perform computations.
   - The LLM decides what calls to make and can make more calls after getting the result back from you so it can break down *complex* computations; this is more effective than relying on the LLM's built-in knowledge or reasoning.
- **Runtimes for the LM Studio**: A user complains that every time **LM Studio** starts, the runtimes must index.
   - The user suggests to check the hashes, but other users said you may have accumulated many more runtimes than you think.

   - There were no responses or further discussion on this topic.
- **Auto-tuning Trigger Conditions**: A member asked when **auto-tuning** is triggered in Triton, specifically if it occurs when a pointer's value changes, or only when properties like shapes, strides, and dtype change.
   - There were no responses or further discussion on this topic.
- **Coalesced Loads via PID Interleaving**: A member sought clarification on why **interleaving PIDs** in Triton to achieve contiguity results in coalesced loads and a performance boost, referencing [this article](https://medium.com/@michael.diggin/implementing-a-split-k-matrix-multiplication-kernel-in-triton-7ad93fe4a54c).
   - They questioned if contiguous memory access within each warp of each PID is sufficient, making PID contiguity irrelevant, but no further explanation or validation was offered.

- ****ARC Sorcery** Makes Mojo Code Work**: A member reported success using [ARC sorcery](https://github.com/modular/modular/blob/3bcfb7203d6fb6cf41560304b383af61d23b065d/mojo/stdlib/stdlib/memory/arc.mojo#L101-L105) to get their Mojo code working, and also noted that they ran into random crashes when using `await` and that `TaskGroup` seems to work.
   - Another member humorously commented that *all programmers are really just sorcerers and wizards fighting demons and dragons*.
- **Tackling **LayoutTensor Parameters****: A member sought help with `LayoutTensor` parameters, posting code snippets and error messages encountered while trying to compute a dot product, eventually needing to use generic origins and **rebind**.
   - Another member explained that *`rebind` is being used a bit like “try harder”*, and that Mojo’s type inference isn’t the most powerful and sometimes requires being more explicit.
- ****Atomic Types** are not Movable in Mojo**: A member inquired why atomic types are not movable in Mojo, noting that they can be moved in Rust.
   - Another member explained that atomic types are typically used for cross-thread coordination, and moving the atomic variable to other memory could lead to either a pointer into invalid memory or two threads suddenly not coordinating.
- ****External Calls** to Libs Discussion**: A member asked about using `external_call` with libraries that come with Max, or if they need to import them using `DLHandle`.
   - A member responded that you can use `external_call` if the lib is linked into the process, which with Max might mean having a runtime and a device instance spun up.
- **Minimal `is_compile_time` Changes Achieve Magical Results**: A member expressed surprise that only three `is_compile_time` changes were needed to make an entire library work, with a link to a [related pull request](https://github.com/bgreni/EmberJson/pull/40).
   - A member noted that Rust with proc macros could achieve something similar.

> `GitHub MCP Server Access from Container, Clay.earth MCP Testing, Streaming Tool Results with MCP, Securing MCP Sessions, Claude Desktop Tool Consent Withdrawal` 


- **MCP access from container with Autogen questioned**: A member inquired why it's not possible to access **GitHub MCP Server** from a container using [Autogen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable//reference/python/autogen_ext.tools.mcp.html).
- **Clay.earth MCP server put to the test**: Members are asked to test the official **clay.earth mcp** to see if they’re able to create a contact successfully.
   - Location is a mandatory parameter but it’s not exposed by the **MCP server**, while clay.earth doesn’t have a publicly accessible API.
- **Trick for streaming MCP tool results**: A member asked if there's a way to stream a tool result with MCP, and another explained that the only way to do it is by sending back chunks via notifications, requiring the client to know how to handle them.
   - Another member added that **ACP** has support for streaming multipart responses, but not **MCP**.
- **MCP sessions secured with Zapier tactics**: Members discussed approaches to securing **MCP sessions**, with one suggesting that most guidance presumes a bearer of the session identifier can be trusted.
   - Another member shared that the spec officially supports **oauth2**, but a **Zapier**-like approach of generating presigned URLs for the actual **MCP server** such as `mcp.mydomain.com/token/sse` is better.
- **Claude Desktop needs consent withdrawal!**: A member is seeking a way to withdraw consent to "Approve always" for a tool in **Claude Desktop** on **Linux**.
   - They requested the addition of a UI feature to withdraw consent and bring back the "Approve for chat" button, urging **Claude Desktop** developers to implement it.

> `MCP Server Security, Client-side vs Server-side Security, VerbalCodeAI Introduction, Aura A2A Agent for Aira Hub, UI in MCP Spec` 


- **MCP Authentication Token Security is Debated**: A discussion arose around the security implications of having an LLM call a tool with code from an email, with concerns raised about potential token leaks to malicious servers.
   - One member suggested [using presigned URLs](https://example.com/presigned) to avoid giving the model access tokens, while another argued that if a model has tool access, it inherently has access to everything the token provides.
- **VerbalCodeAI - AI Codebase Navigation Tool Launches**: A member introduced **VerbalCodeAI**, an AI-powered tool designed to simplify codebase navigation and understanding directly from the terminal, featuring smart code search, analysis, chat features, and an MCP server for smooth integration.
   - The tool is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/vibheksoni/VerbalCodeAi) and has a [website](https://verbalcode.xyz) for more information.
- **Aura: New A2A Agent for Aira Hub Emerges**: A new Agent called **Aura** for the Aira hub (MCP/A2A Hub) was introduced, built with Google ADK and exposing its capabilities via a JSON-RPC server compliant with the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol.
   - The agent's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/IhateCreatingUserNames2/Aura) was shared, with an attached image showcasing its architecture.
- **Client Security vs Server Security Disputed**: A debate occurred over whether security vulnerabilities should be mitigated by the client or if it's the responsibility of the server.
   - One member argued that **relying on client-side heuristics is unreliable**, while another compared client security measures to those implemented by web browsers.
- **UI Integration into MCP Spec Urged**: A member suggested that user interface (UI) considerations need to be added to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification to improve usability and security.
   - They linked to a [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/orgs/modelcontextprotocol/discussions/287) about adding UI to the spec.

> `Beefed-up Jailbreak, Token Limit Woes, Wumpus World Adaptation, Oscar-c Architecture, Attention Span Decay` 


- ****Jailbreak Prevention** Frustrates**: A member expressed disappointment that a model still only has a **200K token max input limit**, referencing [this tweet](https://fxtwitter.com/elder_plinius/status/1925604678982582722) on *beefed-up jailbreak preventions*.
   - Other members questioned use cases needing more than 200K tokens, suggesting it might only be necessary for *chatting with PDFs* or similar tasks.
- ****Oscar-c** Tackles **Wumpus World****: A member is adapting their **AI architecture**, named **Oscar-c**, to play **Wumpus World**, with plans to disable the LLM for planning to encourage independent learning.
   - Another member noted that **Wumpus World** is rudimentary compared to what **Oscar-c** is capable of and that it could also integrate into the **OS** or be the *brain of a game NPC*.
- ****LLM Planning** Abilities Discussed**: A member inquired about an **AI architecture's planning abilities**, suggesting a prompt to *plan a 2026 Robot Olympics*.
   - Another member clarified that while the architecture can plan, it's not its primary design focus, suggesting *any LLM can do that without reasoning*.
- ****Attention Decay** Impacting LLM Performance**: A member has noticed that sentences closer to the end of a prompt are followed more accurately than those at the beginning.
   - Another member confirmed this observation, citing a [paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/reader/fdc53c2c10742464087c0525f77e32604827a21d) indicating that attention is strongest on the diagonal and very first token, adding that *most training doesn’t even come close to the supposed max token limit*.

> `Knowledge Capacity Scaling Laws, GPT-2 vs LLaMA/Mistral, Domain Names Increase Knowledge Capacity` 


- **Knowledge Capacity Scaling Laws Examined**: A discussion was scheduled for the paper "Physics of Language Models: Part 3.3, Knowledge Capacity Scaling Laws," which estimates the number of knowledge bits a model stores [information-theoretically](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5250617).
   - The paper establishes that language models can store **2 bits of knowledge per parameter**, even when quantized to **int8**, and a **7B-parameter model** can store **14B bits** of knowledge.
- **GPT-2 surprisingly rivals LLaMA/Mistral**: The paper's findings include that **GPT-2 with rotary embedding** matches or surpasses **LLaMA/Mistral** architectures in knowledge storage, especially over shorter training durations, due to **GatedMLP** in **LLaMA/Mistral** being less stable and harder to train.
   - There are [12 results](https://physics.allen-zhu.com/part-3-knowledge/part-3-3) on how training duration, model architecture, quantization, sparsity constraints, and data signal-to-noise ratio affect a model’s knowledge-storage capacity.
- **Domain Names Supercharge Knowledge Storage**: The paper notes that *prepending training data with domain names* (e.g., `wikipedia.org`) significantly increases a model’s knowledge capacity, allowing language models to autonomously identify and prioritize knowledge-rich domains.
   - There is also a link to the [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/yBL7J0kgldU?t=2220) of the authors going through the paper.

- **LiteLLM's Logorrhea Silenced**: A member asked about stopping LiteLLM's excessive terminal spam and traced it to possibly MLFlow integration, and a resolution was found by [manually setting the logger to warnings only](https://discord.com/channels/1161519469319946286/1161519470217687103).
   - The solution involved setting `litellm.suppress_debug_info = True` and setting the logging level for both `LiteLLM` and `httpx` loggers to `logging.WARNING`.
- **BoundaryML: BAML or Bust?**: A member inquired about integrating [BAML](https://github.com/BoundaryML/baml) (Boundary Modeling Language) with DSPy for defining prompts.
   - Discussion revolved around whether BAML's approach to prompt structuring could enhance DSPy, with some suggesting it might be redundant to DSPy's native Signatures, and one user complaining their mention of BAML was deleted on grounds that *discussions on <#1161519469319946286> specifically are either to be short and threaded (not multi-post) or on core DSPy concepts*.
- **DSPy: Structuring Prompts**: Members discussed the existing prompt structure in DSPy, pointing out that prompts are currently represented as strings and answers are parsed from strings using `<answer>` tags, leading to a consideration of alternative structuring methods.
   - One member suggested that using BAML for this could improve accuracy, referencing a chart from their website.
- **vLLM's Threads: How Many is Too Many?**: A member questioned the optimal thread count for `module.batch` when running **4** x **Gemma 2 9B** models on vLLM with `tensor-parallel-size` set to **4**.
