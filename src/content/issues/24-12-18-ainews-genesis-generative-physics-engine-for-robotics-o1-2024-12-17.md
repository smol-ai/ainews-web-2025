> You are reading AINews generated by o1-2024-12-17. As is tradition on new frontier model days, we try to publish multiple issues for A/B testing/self evaluation. Check our archives for the o1-mini version. We are sorry for the repeat sends yesterday (platform bug) but today's is on purpose.

December has been the month of [Generative Video World Simulators](https://www.latent.space/p/icml-2024-video-robots) apparently, with Sora Turbo going GA, both [Genie 2](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42317903) and [Veo 2](https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/veo-2/) getting teased by Google. Now, a group of academics [led by CMU PhD student Zhou Xian](https://x.com/zhou_xian_/status/1869511650782658846?s=46) have announced [**Genesis: A Generative and Universal Physics Engine for Robotics and Beyond**](https://genesis-embodied-ai.github.io), a 2 year large scale research collaboration involving over 20 labs, debuting with a drop of water rolling down a Heineken bottle:

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/fe9a08d1-1640-4c7c-9c66-9d93b0318ac9.png?w=960&fit=max)

Because it is a physics engine, it can render the same engine from different camera angles:

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/1ce99dbf-f6f4-4b36-a298-7a8751240348.png?w=960&fit=max) 

as well as expose the driving vectors:

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/21a717f8-4bce-499e-9bcd-a5fa982652ca.png?w=960&fit=max)

The "unified physics engine" integrates various SOTA physics solvers (MPM, SPH, FEM, Rigid Body, PBD, etc.), supporting simulation of a wide range of materials: rigid body, articulated body, Cloth, Liquid, Smoke, Deformables, Thin-shell materials, Elastic/Plastic Body, Robot Muscles, etc.

Rendering consistent objects is immediately useful today, but does not sound like the "purist" bitter pilled approach taken by the big labs - being a pile of physics solvers manually put together rather than machine learned through data - but it does have the advantage of being [open source and usable today](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/Genesis) (no paper yet).

If the purpose were video generation, this would already be impressive, but the real goal is robotics. Genesis is really a platform for 4 things:

1. A **universal physics engine** re-built from the ground up, capable of simulating a wide range of materials and physical phenomena.
2. A **lightweight**, **ultra-fast**, **pythonic**, and **user-friendly** robotics simulation platform.
3. A powerful and fast **photo-realistic rendering system**.
3. A **generative data engine** that transforms user-prompted natural language description into various modalities of data.

and it should be the robotics applications that should really shine.

# AI Discord Recap

> A summary of Summaries of Summaries by o1-2024-12-17

**Theme 1. Challenges in AI Extensions and Projects**  

- **Codeium Extension Breaks Briefly in VSCode**: The extension only displays autocomplete suggestions for a split second, making it unusable. Reverting to version 1.24.8 restores proper functionality, according to multiple user reports.  
- **Windsurf Performance Crumbles Under Heavy Load**: Some users experience over 10-minute load times and sporadic “disappearing code” or broken Cascade functionality. Filing support tickets is the top recommendation until a stable fix arrives.  
- **Bolt Users Cry Foul Over Wasted Tokens**: They jokingly proposed a *“punch the AI”* button after receiving irrelevant responses that deplete credits. Many called for improved memory controls in upcoming releases.

**Theme 2. New and Upgraded Models**  

- [**OpenAI o1 Dazzles With Function Calling**](https://openrouter.ai/openai/o1-preview): This successor to o1-preview introduces a new *“reasoning_effort”* parameter to control how long it thinks before replying. It also features noticeably lower latency through [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai).  
- [**EVA Llama Emerges as a Storytelling Specialist**](https://openrouter.ai/eva-unit-01/eva-llama-3.33-70b): Targeted at roleplay and narrative tasks, it reportedly excels at multi-step storytelling. Early adopters praise its creative outputs and user-friendly design.  
- **Major Price Cuts on Fan-Favorite Models**: MythoMax 13B dropped by 12.5% and the QwQ reasoning model plunged 55%. These discounts aim to widen community access for experimentation.

**Theme 3. GPU & Inference Pitfalls**  

- **AMD Driver Updates Slash Performance**: Users saw tokens-per-second plummet from 90+ to around 20 when upgrading from driver 24.10.1 to 24.12.1. Rolling back fixes the slowdown, reinforcing caution with fresh GPU driver releases.  
- **Stable Diffusion on Ubuntu Hits Snags**: Tools like ComfyUI or Forge UI often demand in-depth Linux know-how to fix compatibility issues. Many still recommend an NVIDIA 3060 with 16GB VRAM as a smoother baseline.  
- [**TinyGrad, Torch, and CUDA Memory Confusion**](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/reduce-time-to-first-kernel-when-using-cuda-graphs/214310): Removing checks like *IsDense(y) && IsSame(x, y)* solved unexpected inference failures, but introduced new complexities. This led developers to reference official CUDA Graphs discussions for potential solutions.

**Theme 4. Advanced Fine-Tuning & RAG Techniques**  

- [**Fine-Tuning Llama 3.2 With 4-bit Conversions**](https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/tutorial-how-to-finetune-llama-3-and-use-in-ollama): Many rely on *load_in_4bit=true* to balance VRAM usage and model accuracy. Checkpoints can be reused, and resource constraints are minimized through partial-precision settings.  
- [**Depth AI Indexes Codebases at Scale**](https://www.trydepth.ai/): It attains *99% accuracy* answering technical queries, though indexing 180k tokens may take 40 minutes. Rival solutions like [LightRAG](https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG) exist, but Depth AI is praised for simpler setup.  
- [**Gemini 2.0 Adds Google Search Grounding**](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/7257): A new configuration allows real-time web lookups to refine answers. Early reviews highlight improved factual precision in coding and Q&A scenarios.

**Theme 5. NotebookLM and Agentic Workflows**  

- **NotebookLM Revamps Its 3-Panel UI**: The update removed *“suggested actions”* due to low usage, but developers promise to reintroduce similar features with better design. Plans include boosted *“citations”* and *“response accuracy”* based on user feedback.  
- **Multilingual Prompts Spark Wide Engagement**: Users tried Brazilian Portuguese and Bangla queries, discovering that explicitly *telling* NotebookLM the language context makes interactions more fluid. This showcases its capability for inclusive global communication.  
- **Controlling Podcast Length Remains Elusive**: Even with time specifications in prompts, final outputs often exceed or ignore constraints. Most rely on flexible length ranges to strike a balance between deep coverage and listener engagement.

> `FSDP Adjustment, Bug Fix in TRL, Loss Scaling Discussion, Gradient Scaling, Optimizer in Backward Case`

- **FSDP Adjustment Needed for Scaling**: Members concur that if the **FSDP** reduce operation averages, scaling by `world_size` is necessary to undo this effect in the gradient calculation.
  
  - This adjustment would involve only changing the call to `scale_grads` in the provided code example, simplifying the implementation.
- **Potential Bug in TRL**: A member suggested that a bug related to scaling exists in the **trl** library that might be pervasive, implying it could affect other areas as well.
  
  - The discussion hints at an opportunity for a bug fix report styled after **Unsloth** if the scaling error is confirmed to be widespread.
- **Scaling Loss in Training Recipes**: There was a consensus among members that scaling the loss directly in the training recipe is preferable for maintaining explicitness and clarity in code.
  
  - Members discussed the implications of scaling strategies, indicating that additional comments should accompany the code modifications for better understanding.
- **Gradient Scaling Consideration**: The team explored whether adjusting the gradient scaling appropriately in different scenarios might require various solutions, especially in relation to no-sync cases.
  
  - One member emphasized the preference for explicit scaling in the training loop rather than relying on hidden adjustments in hooks.
- **Optimizer in Backward Case Fix**: An update was made to include a scaling factor for the **optimizer_in_bwd** case in the ongoing PR, addressing concerns about loss normalization.
  
  - The member noted a clearer approach is being taken to handle scaling directly in the recipe for improved code readability and maintainability.
