date: '2024-11-12T01:33:12.109076Z'
original_slug: ainews-frontiermath-a-benchmark-for-evaluating
description: >-
  **Epoch AI** collaborated with over **60 leading mathematicians** to create
  the **FrontierMath benchmark**, a fresh set of hundreds of original math
  problems with easy-to-verify answers, aiming to challenge current AI models.
  The benchmark reveals that all tested models, including **o1**, perform
  poorly, highlighting the difficulty of complex problem-solving and **Moravec's
  paradox** in AI. Key AI developments include the introduction of
  **Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT)**, a sparse multi-modal transformer
  architecture reducing computational costs, and improvements in
  **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting** through incorrect reasoning and
  explanations. Industry news covers **OpenAI** acquiring the **chat.com**
  domain, **Microsoft** launching the **Magentic-One agent framework**,
  **Anthropic** releasing **Claude 3.5 Haiku** outperforming **gpt-4o** on some
  benchmarks, and **xAI** securing **150MW grid power** with support from **Elon
  Musk** and **Trump**. **LangChain AI** introduced new tools including a
  **Financial Metrics API**, **Document GPT** with PDF upload and Q&A, and
  **LangPost** AI agent for LinkedIn posts. **xAI** also demonstrated the **Grok
  Engineer** compatible with OpenAI and Anthropic APIs for code generation.

Fresh benchmarks are like [a fresh blanket of snow](https://x.com/polynoamial/status/1855691777749176601), because they [saturate so quickly](https://x.com/jackclarkSF/status/1855374134907138393), but Terence Tao figures FrontierMath will at least buy us a couple years. [o1 surprisingly underperforms the other models but it is statistically insignificant](https://x.com/sytelus/status/1855531936762278094) because -all- models score so low.

- **[A team from MIT built a model that scores 61.9% on ARC-AGI-PUB using an 8B LLM plus Test-Time-Training (TTT). Previous record was 42%.](https://i.redd.it/x1h4rkb3z50e1.png)** ([Score: 343, Comments: 46](https://reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gof0o1/a_team_from_mit_built_a_model_that_scores_619_on/)): A team from **MIT** developed a model achieving **61.9%** on **ARC-AGI-PUB** using an **8B LLM** combined with **Test-Time-Training (TTT)**, surpassing the previous record of **42%**.
  - **Test-Time-Training (TTT)** is a focal point of discussion, with some users questioning its fairness and legitimacy, comparing it to a "cheat" or joke, while others clarify that TTT does not train on the test answers but uses examples to fine-tune the model before predictions. References include the paper "Pretraining on the Test Set Is All You Need" ([arxiv.org/abs/2309.08632](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08632)) and TTT's website ([yueatsprograms.github.io/ttt/home.html](https://yueatsprograms.github.io/ttt/home.html)).
  - The **ARC benchmark** is seen as a challenging task that has been significantly advanced by MIT's model, achieving **61.9%** accuracy, with discussions around the importance of optimizing models for specific tasks versus creating general-purpose systems. Some users argue for specialized optimization, while others emphasize the need for general systems capable of optimizing across various tasks.
  - There is skepticism about the broader applicability of the paper's findings, with some users noting that the model is heavily optimized for ARC rather than general use. The discussion also touches on the future of AI, with references to the "bitter lesson" and the potential for **AGI** (Artificial General Intelligence) to emerge from models that can dynamically modify themselves during use.

There is speculation that if the 32B model lives up to expectations, it could position **China** as a leader in open-source AI development.
  - **Technical Challenges and Innovations**: Discussions included the potential for training models to bypass high-level languages and directly translate from English to machine language, which would involve generating synthetic coding examples and compiling them to machine language. This approach would require overcoming challenges related to performance, compatibility, and optimization for specific architectures.
  - **AI's Role in Coding Efficiency**: Users expressed optimism about AI improving coding workflows, with references to **Cursor-quality** workflows potentially becoming available for free in the future. There was humor about AI's ability to quickly fix simple errors like missing semicolons, which currently require significant debugging time.


- **[I'm ready for Qwen 2.5 32b, had to do some cramming though.](https://i.redd.it/x6saryug870e1.jpeg)** ([Score: 124, Comments: 45](https://reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gojtwg/im_ready_for_qwen_25_32b_had_to_do_some_cramming/)): **Qwen 2.5 32B** is generating excitement within the community, suggesting anticipation for its capabilities and potential applications. The mention of "cramming" indicates users are preparing extensively to utilize this model effectively.
  - Discussions around **token per second (t/s) performance** highlight varied results with different hardware; users report 3.5-4.5 t/s on an **M3 Max 128GB** and 18-20 t/s with **3x3090** using **exllama**. There is curiosity about t/s performance of **M40** running **Qwen 2.5 32B**.
  - The relevance of **M series cards** is debated, with comments noting the **M40 24G** is particularly sought after, yet prices have increased, making them less cost-effective compared to other options. Users express surprise at their continued utility in modern applications.
