OpenAI's Evals team is back for [a third time](https://x.com/swyx/status/1971404125553242253) this year with [GDPVal](https://openai.com/index/gdpval/), which they are framing as a logical next step in model evals with the breadth of MMLU, but with the depth of agentic benchmarks like SWE-Bench and their own SWE-Lancer. **GDPval** ([full paper here](https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/d5eb7428-c4e9-4a33-bd86-86dd4bcf12ce/GDPval.pdf#page=6.54)) takes its name from a top down selection of major (>5%) sectors of GDP, filtered for "predominantly digital" knowledge work:

This resulted in 1,320 tasks across 44 occupations, which were then evaluated against models and human experts averaging 14 years of experience in those fields:

The two primary results charts are hugely validating: first that OpenAI doesn't bias towards itseslf, and that Opus is within spitting distance of industry expert output:

and the model trendlines over time have GPTnext matching human performance roughly by mid 2026:

The word AGI isn't mentioned at all in the paper, but the original 2018? OpenAI charter defined AGI as "highly autonomous systems that **outperform humans at most economically valuable work**”. If we were to wake up in Sept 2026 and find that GPT6-high-ultrathink-final-for-realsies was above confidence interval of 50% in GDPVal pairwise comparisons, then we could truly say that we have achieved AGI by 2018 standards.

# AI Reddit Recap

## /r/LocalLlama + /r/localLLM Recap

### 1. China AI Model Launches: Alibaba Qwen Extreme-Scaling Roadmap & Tencent Hunyuan Image 3.0

- [**Alibaba just unveiled their Qwen roadmap. The ambition is staggering!**](https://i.redd.it/5tm4p90rt9rf1.jpeg) ([Score: 662, Comments: 146](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nq182d/alibaba_just_unveiled_their_qwen_roadmap_the/)): **Alibaba’s Qwen roadmap slide signals an aggressive bet on unified multimodal models and extreme scaling: context length from** `1M → 100M` **tokens, parameters from ~**`1T → 10T`**, test‑time compute from** `64k → 1M` **tokens, and training data from** `10T → 100T` **tokens, alongside “unlimited-scale” synthetic data generation and expanded agent capabilities (complexity, interaction, learning). The plan echoes a “scaling is all you need” philosophy, implying massive compute, data curation, and inference optimization challenges for memory bandwidth, KV‑cache management, long‑context attention (e.g., hybrid/linear/sparse), and reliability of synthetic data pipelines.** Commenters question feasibility/practicality: a `100M` context window and `>1T` parameter models strain hardware and inference costs, likely pushing deployments to closed, cloud-only settings; others ask what local compute could realistically handle trillion‑scale models, implying reliance on quantization, MoE, or offloading schemes.
    - Several latch onto the “100M context” teased in the roadmap ([image](https://preview.redd.it/4nzxogoa1arf1.jpeg?width=582&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d31c845a948a3d2b68d994008ac0c5c18dc45a96)). Naive quadratic attention makes this intractable at scale: for a ~32-layer, ~4k-hidden decoder, FP16 KV cache is ≈`0.5 MB/token`, so `100M` tokens implies ≈`50 TB` of VRAM (even 4-bit KV would still be ≈`12.5 TB`). Hitting that target would require sparse/linear/streaming attention (e.g., block-sparse, ring/streaming), retrieval/chunking, aggressive KV quantization/offload, and careful bandwidth-optimized kernels; compute optimizations like FlashAttention help constants but not O(n^2) scaling.
    - Re: “run >1T locally?”—weight storage alone dominates: `1T` params at `int4` ≈ `500 GB` (FP16 ≈ `2 TB`) before KV cache, which at long contexts adds hundreds of GB to multi-TB. Realistically this needs multi-GPU servers (e.g., `8–16×80 GB` with NVLink/NVSwitch) with tensor+pipeline parallelism; per-token compute is ≈O(P) (~`2e12` FLOPs/token), so `10–30` tok/s needs roughly `20–60` TFLOP/s sustained, but memory bandwidth and collective comms are the primary bottlenecks rather than raw FLOPs.
- [**Tencent is teasing the world’s most powerful open-source text-to-image model, Hunyuan Image 3.0 Drops Sept 28**](https://i.redd.it/t8w84ihz1crf1.jpeg) ([Score: 173, Comments: 26](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nqaiaz/tencent_is_teasing_the_worlds_most_powerful/)): **Tencent teased Hunyuan Image 3.0, an open‑source text‑to‑image model slated for release on Sept 28, claiming it will be the “most powerful” open-source option. The teaser implies a** `96 GB VRAM` **requirement (at least for some inference modes), but provides no public benchmarks, architecture details, training data, or throughput/latency metrics yet; thus the performance claim is unverified pending release. Image: https://i.redd.it/t8w84ihz1crf1.jpeg** Commenters are skeptical of heavy pre‑release hype, noting that strong models often arrive with minimal marketing (e.g., Qwen) and citing past overhyped releases (e.g., SD3 vs FLUX). Others point out the “most powerful” label is premature without apples‑to‑apples open‑source comparisons; one commenter confirms the `VRAM 96` detail from the teaser.
    - Rumored `~96 GB VRAM` requirement for inference suggests a very large diffusion/DiT backbone or high‑res latent configuration, which exceeds single consumer GPUs (24–48 GB). Expect heavy reliance on memory optimizations (attention slicing, tiled VAE), CPU/NVLink offload, model sharding or multi‑GPU tensor parallelism; quantization for diffusion U‑Nets is less mature and can hurt quality. Memory footprint versus resolution/steps trade‑offs will be critical for practical local use.
    - Several note a pattern where heavily teased releases underdeliver versus “shadow‑dropped” ones (e.g., **Qwen**), citing SD3 vs FLUX as precedent. They want hard numbers before believing *“most powerful”*: side‑by‑side prompts vs Qwen Image/FLUX/SDXL with FID/CLIPScore/HPSv2, plus tests for text rendering, small‑object counting, multi‑subject composition, and prompt faithfulness. Without a data card and reproducible evals, the claim reads as marketing.
    - Immediate ask for ComfyUI support; feasibility hinges on whether Hunyuan Image 3.0 sticks to an SDXL‑style pipeline or introduces custom schedulers/blocks. If it’s DiT‑like (as in prior Hunyuan releases), a loader node with FlashAttention 2/xFormers should suffice; otherwise custom CUDA kernels and sampler nodes may be needed. Community will look for FP16 checkpoints, ONNX/TensorRT exports, and sampler compatibility (DDIM/DPM++/DPMSolver) to gauge ease of adoption.

### 2. Local AI Alternatives: Fenghua No.3 CUDA/DirectX GPU + Post-Abliteration Uncensored LLM Finetunes

- [**China already started making CUDA and DirectX supporting GPUs, so over of monopoly of NVIDIA. The Fenghua No.3 supports latest APIs, including DirectX 12, Vulkan 1.2, and OpenGL 4.6.**](https://i.redd.it/kvkovm34x9rf1.png) ([Score: 454, Comments: 124](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nq1ia2/china_already_started_making_cuda_and_directx/)): **Post claims China’s Fenghua No.3 GPU natively supports modern graphics/compute APIs:** `DirectX 12`**,** `Vulkan 1.2`**,** `OpenGL 4.6`**, and even NVIDIA’s CUDA, suggesting a potential alternative to NVIDIA’s ecosystem. The image appears to be a product/spec slide, but no driver maturity details, CUDA compatibility layer notes, or benchmarks are provided, so real-world parity and performance remain unverified. Contextually, CUDA “support” could mean a reimplementation/translation layer (akin to AMD’s HIP: https://github.com/ROCm/HIP or projects like ZLUDA: https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA), which can be legally and technically fraught unless fully clean-room and robustly tested.** Top comments highlight that AMD already offers CUDA-compatibility via HIP and that Chinese vendors may ignore legal/IP constraints to advertise CUDA outright; others remain skeptical (“I’ll believe it when I see it”) and anticipate geopolitical pushback. Overall sentiment questions readiness, driver quality, and legality more than the headline API list.
    - Several point out AMD already provides a CUDA-like path: **HIP/ROCm** enables source-level portability by mapping CUDA APIs to HIP (avoiding NVIDIA trademarks/legal issues), while projects like **ZLUDA** attempt binary-level CUDA driver/runtime translation to run unmodified CUDA apps on non‑NVIDIA GPUs. Practically, this means many CUDA kernels can be auto-translated/recompiled for AMD with minimal code changes via [HIP](https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP), whereas [ZLUDA](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) targets drop‑in execution of existing CUDA binaries—coverage and performance remain dependent on driver maturity and parity with newer CUDA features.
- [**IMPORTANT: Why Abliterated Models SUCK. Here is a better way to uncensor LLMs.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nq0cp9/important_why_abliterated_models_suck_here_is_a/) ([Score: 273, Comments: 80](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nq0cp9/important_why_abliterated_models_suck_here_is_a/)): **OP reports that weight-space “abliteration” (uncensoring) of LLMs—especially MoE like Qwen3-30B-A3B—consistently degrades reasoning, agentic/tool-use behavior, and increases hallucinations, often causing** `30B` **abliterated models to underperform non‑abliterated** `4–8B` **models. In their tests, abliterated+finetuned models largely “recover” capabilities: [mradermacher/Qwen3-30B-A3B-abliterated-erotic-i1-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Qwen3-30B-A3B-abliterated-erotic-i1-GGUF) (tested** `i1-Q4_K_S`**) approaches base Qwen3-30B-A3B performance with lower hallucination vs other abliterated Qwen3 variants and better tool-calling via [MCP](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol); [mlabonne/NeuralDaredevil-8B-abliterated](https://huggingface.co/mlabonne/NeuralDaredevil-8B-abliterated) (DPO FT from Llama3‑8B) reportedly outperforms its base while remaining uncensored. Direct comparisons against abliterated-only builds—[Huihui-Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507-abliterated-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/Huihui-Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507-abliterated-GGUF), [Huihui-Qwen3-30B-A3B-abliterated-Fusion-9010-i1-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/Huihui-Qwen3-30B-A3B-abliterated-Fusion-9010-i1-GGUF), [Huihui-Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507-abliterated-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/Huihui-Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507-abliterated-GGUF)—found unrealistic responses to illicit-task prompts, frequent wrong/repetitive tool calls, and higher hallucination than the finetuned abliterated model (though still slightly worse than the original).** Comments call for a standardized benchmark to quantify “abliteration” degradation beyond NSFW tasks and frame the observed recovery as “model healing”: post-edit finetuning lets the network relearn connections broken by unconstrained weight edits. A skeptical view argues that if finetuning is required anyway, abliteration adds risk without benefit—claiming they’ve never seen abliteration+finetune beat a straight finetune.
    - Several commenters note that arbitrary weight edits ("abliteration") introduce uncontrolled distribution shift and capability loss; this is essentially known as **model healing**: if you perturb weights without a training signal, you should expect degraded reasoning/knowledge, and only further fine-tuning with a proper loss can partially restore the broken circuits. Practitioners report that an abliterated-then-fine-tuned model rarely outperforms a plain fine-tune on the same base, implying the edit adds optimization debt without measurable gains in benchmarks.
    - There’s a call for evaluation beyond porn-centric tests; the **Uncensored General Intelligence (UGI) Benchmark**/leaderboard aims to quantify broad capabilities of uncensored models (reasoning, coding, knowledge, etc.) while minimizing refusal artifacts: https://huggingface.co/spaces/DontPlanToEnd/UGI-Leaderboard. Using UGI (or similar multi-domain suites) would better capture whether uncensoring preserves general performance versus causing regressions.
    - As alternatives to abliteration, users recommend uncensored fine-tunes known to retain utility, e.g., **Qwen3-8B** `192k` **Josiefied** GGUF builds (https://huggingface.co/DavidAU/Qwen3-8B-192k-Josiefied-Uncensored-NEO-Max-GGUF), **Dolphin-Mistral-24B** variants (https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Dolphin-Mistral-24B-Venice-Edition-i1-GGUF), and models from **TheDrummer** (https://huggingface.co/TheDrummer). These are cited as better baselines for uncensoring that can be benchmarked head-to-head on UGI to validate capability retention.

### 1. Gemini Robotics 1.5 and Veo 3 Zero‑Shot Video Reasoning

- [**Gemini Robotics 1.5**](https://v.redd.it/7c3xep1jpcrf1) ([Score: 276, Comments: 39](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1nqe32v/gemini_robotics_15/)): **Google DeepMind announces “Gemini Robotics 1.5,” a Gemini-1.5–based multimodal VLA that maps natural language + vision to robot control for long‑horizon, multi‑step manipulation across diverse embodiments, with demos like laundry sorting, desk organization, and full scene reset/rollback ([page](https://deepmind.google/models/gemini-robotics/)). Building on prior VLA lines (e.g., RT‑2/RT‑X), it emphasizes open‑vocabulary object/tool grounding, hierarchical task decomposition via the model’s long context, and generalization without per‑task fine‑tuning, enabling “return to initial state” behaviors and multi‑object organization.** Technically oriented commenters highlight the significance of robust scene restoration as a practical household primitive (canonical “reset” to a predefined state), and speculate on direct transfer to agriculture (e.g., fruit picking) as a scalable, high‑impact application domain.
    - Applying this to fruit picking is a non-trivial jump from laundry: outdoor, unstructured scenes introduce variable lighting, occlusions, and deformable/fragile-object handling that demand closed-loop vision, tactile/force feedback, compliant/soft grippers, and robust visual servoing. Generalist VLA policies (e.g., **RT‑2**’s open‑vocabulary affordance grounding) could help map language goals like “pick the ripe apple” to action primitives, but success will hinge on on‑board latency, multi-view perception, and slip‑aware grasp release [https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/rt-2/].
    - The “restore the scene to a canonical state” use case is essentially goal‑conditioned manipulation with persistent memory: maintain an object‑centric scene graph, compute deltas to a reference snapshot, then plan multi‑step rearrangements. Methods like **Transporter Nets** for keypoint‑based pick‑and‑place and visual goal‑conditioned policies can execute “tidy to match this image” behaviors, but need robust relocalization, clutter segmentation, and failure recovery to avoid compounding errors over long horizons [https://transporternets.github.io/].
    - “All robots share the same mind” maps to fleet learning: centralized policy/parameter sharing across heterogeneous embodiments with periodic cloud updates, as seen in multi-robot datasets/policies like **RT‑X** [https://robotics-transformer-x.github.io/]. Practical deployments add embodiment adapters and may favor **federated learning** for privacy/safety; core challenges are distribution shift across morphologies/sensors, catastrophic forgetting in continual learning, and sim2real drift, mitigated via domain randomization and strong regularization.
- [**Video models are zero-shot learners and reasoners**](https://v.redd.it/ltzwnm26u9rf1) ([Score: 238, Comments: 30](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1nq1a2h/video_models_are_zeroshot_learners_and_reasoners/)): **The post highlights a project and paper claiming that the generative video model Veo 3 exhibits broad zero-shot capabilities—without task-specific training or language mediation—across segmentation, edge detection, image editing, physical property inference, affordance recognition, tool-use simulation, and early visual reasoning tasks (e.g., maze and symmetry solving). Drawing a parallel to LLM emergence, the authors argue that scaling large, web-trained generative video models could yield general-purpose vision understanding, positioning video models as potential unified vision foundation models; see the project page and demos at https://video-zero-shot.github.io/ and the paper at https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20328. Notably, the materials appear primarily qualitative: no disclosed parameter counts, compute, training corpus specifics, standardized benchmarks, or ablations are evident, limiting rigorous comparison and reproducibility.** Commenters speculate that coherent long-horizon video generation implies a strong learned world model and that further scaling could improve capabilities, while also noting the significant compute cost of video models and proposing integration with LLMs into a single multimodal model; several request basic model details (e.g., Veo 3 size).
    - Several commenters infer that high-quality video generation (e.g., Google’s claimed Veo 3) implies a learned “world model” that enforces temporal coherence and basic physics, which can surface as zero-shot reasoning. This aligns with prior world-model work like **DeepMind’s Genie** (interactive environment model) that learns dynamics from video ([blog](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie/)). The core idea: to produce consistent frames, models must internalize object permanence, motion continuity, and causality—capabilities that also benefit downstream reasoning without task-specific finetuning.
    - There’s a practical scaling constraint: video modeling explodes token/computation compared to text. A `10s` video at `24 fps` and `720p` patchified at `16x16` yields roughly `(1280/16)*(720/16)=3600` tokens per frame ⇒ `~864k` tokens per clip; even with latent compression (8–16×) and diffusion/flow-matching in a VAE latent, training/inference FLOPs dwarf LLMs. This motivates hybrid systems (LLM for planning/reasoning + specialized video generator) or unified backbones with shared token spaces to amortize compute across modalities.
    - On multimodality, participants note gaps: video-in exists in LMMs (e.g., **Gemini 1.5** can process long videos via large context windows, reportedly up to “hours” with frame sampling; see [Gemini 1.5](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-next-generation-model-february-2024/)), and **GPT-4o** supports real-time video input ([OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-system-card/)). But truly unified video-in + video-out + reasoning in one released model remains uncommon; current practice chains a reasoning LLM with a T2V model (e.g., **Veo**, **Sora**) or explores research Video-LLMs like **LLaVA-Video** ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03300)) and **Video-LLaMA** ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08485)) that focus on video understanding rather than generation. This is the integration frontier commenters expect next.

### 2. LLM Reasoning Reliability: Apple vs Anthropic and GPT‑5 Regression Reports

- [**Apple called out every major AI company for fake reasoning and Anthropic's response proves their point**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1nq9txw/apple_called_out_every_major_ai_company_for_fake/) ([Score: 377, Comments: 198](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1nq9txw/apple_called_out_every_major_ai_company_for_fake/)): **Apple ML’s “The Illusion of Thinking” (https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/illusion-of-thinking) evaluates LLM “reasoning” by applying semantically preserving but surface-level perturbations to math/logic word problems and reports sharp accuracy drops, arguing models lack invariances expected of algorithmic reasoning and instead exploit spurious patterns. Anthropic’s reply, “The Illusion of the Illusion of Thinking” (https://arxiv.org/html/2506.09250v1), contends Apple’s setup induces distribution shift/annotation artifacts and that under controlled prompts and “fairer” conditions Claude’s performance is stable—framing the brittleness as an evaluation issue rather than a model incapacity. The debate centers on robustness to content‑preserving rewordings, metric overfitting, and whether current LLMs demonstrate reasoning-like generalization versus sophisticated pattern matching.** Top commenters largely endorse Apple’s critique that LLMs don’t “reason,” share the two papers, and describe the practical stack: tokenization to numeric IDs, assistant/policy layers that filter/steer IO (e.g., safety/RLHF), and decoding choices that can induce degenerate outputs (e.g., repetitive tokens when sampling is misconfigured)—implying observed failures can reflect pipeline/decoding brittleness as much as model limits.
    - Several commenters unpack the production stack around LLMs: the user-facing model tokenizes text into subword tokens and predicts the next token, while “outer” layers (system prompts, safety/guardrail classifiers, pre-/post-processing rewriters, and routing/orchestration) constrain and shape outputs. This wrapper design explains behaviors like unreliable verbatim recall of training data (knowledge stored parametrically vs. indexed) and why base-model behavior can differ from the product experience (e.g., RLHF and filtering altering likelihoods).
    - Technical failure modes were highlighted, e.g., early repetition loops like “the the the…” arising from decoding pathologies when high-probability tokens dominate. Mis-tuned decoding (`temperature`, `top-k`/`top-p`) and lack of penalties can cause low-entropy degeneracy; mitigations include `repetition/frequency/presence` penalties, nucleus sampling, and entropy-boosting heuristics—issues widely observed in early GPT-2/3-era systems before guardrails stabilized outputs.
    - On the “reasoning” debate, commenters argue for operational definitions and capability-focused evaluation rather than labels, noting that small perturbations of logically equivalent prompts often break solutions—evidence of pattern matching over robust inference. Links to primary sources were shared for deeper analysis: Apple ML’s “Illusion of Thinking” research note (https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/illusion-of-thinking) and an arXiv preprint (https://arxiv.org/html/2506.09250v1), encouraging benchmarked, perturbation-robust assessments over marketing claims.
- [**ChatGPT is in such a bad state my most novice students have noticed it going off rails**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1nq0kh2/chatgpt_is_in_such_a_bad_state_my_most_novice/) ([Score: 211, Comments: 90](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1nq0kh2/chatgpt_is_in_such_a_bad_state_my_most_novice/)): **An AI-integration instructor reports a sharp post-update regression in OpenAI’s assistant (referred to as “GPT5”): a long-standing master prompt that previously produced** `~2000`**word, exam-focused summaries with [GPT‑4o](https://openai.com/index/omni) now yields generic prose with “wild inaccuracies,” requires up to** `5` **back-and-forth clarifications, and frequently drifts off-instruction. In side-by-side use, Google’s [Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/gemini) and [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/), plus Anthropic [Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/claude), still deliver consistent results; the user also claims a local Gemma-family model with** `~1B` **parameters (e.g., [Gemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma)) outperforms the hosted model for their healthcare-education summarization workflow. Based on this observed reliability drop for converting multi-hour lectures/readings into concise notes, the instructor advised canceling the paid plan pending improvement.** Top comments echo a noticeable capability decline and reduced trust for research-assistant use cases, claiming a broader cross-model dip. Others express strong skepticism that a `~1B`parameter Gemma could substantively outperform OpenAI’s latest model, implying potential evaluation or prompting confounds.
    - Multiple users report noticeable capability regression in recent ChatGPT releases, especially for research/analysis workflows: perceived rise in hallucinations, "lazy"/short outputs, and failures on formerly trivial tasks, leading some to abandon it for critical work. This aligns with concerns about model routing or safety/latency tuning affecting behavior, though no hard benchmarks were cited by commenters.
    - A claim that a "Gemma 1B" outperforms GPT drew skepticism; publicly released **Gemma** variants are typically 2B/7B (Gemma 1/1.1) and 2B/9B (Gemma 2) [docs](https://ai.google.dev/gemma). At ~1–2B scale, models generally lag GPT‑4‑class systems on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, GSM8K), so a 1B model exceeding GPT on broad tasks would be atypical outside narrow domains or with heavy tool/RAG support.
    - One practical workaround mentioned: enable "legacy models" in ChatGPT settings to access **GPT‑4o** if the default routing feels degraded. This suggests model selection/routing changes may be impacting quality; testing side‑by‑side (same prompts across 4o vs current default) can help isolate regressions [OpenAI model list](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models).
- [**I am losing my f*cking mind with the image generation filters.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1npt1du/i_am_losing_my_fcking_mind_with_the_image/) ([Score: 503, Comments: 56](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1npt1du/i_am_losing_my_fcking_mind_with_the_image/)): **User reports inconsistent safety-filter behavior in GPT image generation: an arachnid-like monster image was initially allowed ([example preview](https://preview.redd.it/dkmt0tl5j7rf1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=46757cb105b97525c1800607b853c141e6bb0b8d)), but subsequent requests for a less-realistic, bestiary/DnD-style rendering were blocked, as were prompts involving** `werewolf`**,** `blood`**, and** `glowing red eyes`**. The pattern suggests keyword- and style-sensitive moderation with possible non-determinism (same concept sometimes passes, sometimes fails), leading to false positives on fantasy/horror content rather than explicit gore or realism thresholds.** Commenters suggest a workaround: use ChatGPT to craft a highly detailed prompt, then generate the image with an alternative model (e.g., Grok) that has looser filters. Others note frequent false positives (e.g., benign prompts flagged for “nudity”), arguing current safety heuristics are brittle and overbroad.
    - Content moderation appears overly sensitive: a prompt for a realistic trout drying itself with a beach towel was flagged for nudity, indicating false positives where benign anthropomorphic scenarios are conflated with explicit content. This points to coarse-grained safety classifiers or keyword heuristics that degrade usability by blocking non-explicit requests.
    - A user reports stable local generation with Stable Diffusion via the Stability Matrix UI on a single RTX-3090, describing text-to-image inference as fast and reliable, albeit a step behind state-of-the-art image models. Running locally provides control and eliminates hosted platform filters, with performance adequate on commodity high-VRAM GPUs.
    - Workflow suggestions included using ChatGPT to craft highly detailed prompts, then feeding them to alternative generators like Grok; others noted rephrasing via Gemini sometimes reduced moderation friction. Separating prompt engineering from inference can improve output quality and reduce false-positive triggers from stricter front-end filters.
- [**How ChatGPT helped me quit weed and understand the roots of my addiction**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1nqboo1/how_chatgpt_helped_me_quit_weed_and_understand/) ([Score: 428, Comments: 120](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1nqboo1/how_chatgpt_helped_me_quit_weed_and_understand/)): **OP reports quitting daily cannabis use after** `17 years` **by leveraging [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) as an on‑demand support tool. They used it to (1) explain withdrawal symptoms in real time (e.g., chest pressure, insomnia, vivid dreams), (2) normalize stage‑specific experiences, (3) reframe cravings as "old programming" vs identity, and (4) facilitate structured reflection on root causes (strict upbringing, insecurity, loneliness, creative blockage). Outcome:** `9 weeks` **abstinent, markedly reduced cravings, improved sleep, and increased present‑state awareness; OP characterizes ChatGPT as a 24/7 therapist/coach/mirror substitute.** Top comments are largely supportive (one echoing a `30+`‑year struggle), with one contrarian remark implying AI enabled continuous use without consequences—highlighting debate over AI as recovery aid vs potential enabler.
- [**ChatGPT has been helping me fight my divorce for the last year**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1npvsaw/chatgpt_has_been_helping_me_fight_my_divorce_for/) ([Score: 333, Comments: 97](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1npvsaw/chatgpt_has_been_helping_me_fight_my_divorce_for/)): **A pro se litigant in a contested Texas divorce/child-support case (two children) reports using ChatGPT to draft and format filings—declarations, hardship statements, and evidence lists—by supplying fact‑constrained instructions and performing multi‑pass manual verification. After a 3‑month temporary‑orders phase and counsel predicting an unfavorable deviation outcome, he dismissed counsel and continued self‑represented, seeking a deviation from Texas guideline child support (≈**`$1,100`**/mo; see Texas guidelines [Family Code §154.125](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/FA/htm/FA.154.htm) and [OAG calculator](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/child-support/calculating-child-support)) while on a fixed 100% VA disability as the former stay‑at‑home parent, asserting the other party is employed with free housing. He credits ChatGPT with improved structure, issue‑spotting, and reduced emotional content in written records, using filings to compensate for limited in‑court advocacy amid opposing counsel’s threats of sanctions and delays.** Commenters warn about LLM hallucinations in legal research, citing the sanctions in Mata v. Avianca for fabricated case law generated by ChatGPT ([order](https://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/2023-06/Mata%20v.%20Avianca%2022-cv-1461%20-%20Sanctions%20Order.pdf)), urging strict verification of citations and precedents. Others argue LLMs can outperform lawyers in drafting clarity if kept factual, noting courts may respond favorably to precise, well‑supported filings from pro se parties.
    - Multiple commenters flag legal hallucination risk: one references the widely publicized Avianca incident where an attorney submitted ChatGPT-fabricated case citations and was sanctioned; they urge rigorous verification of all citations/precedents against primary sources before filing or arguing in court ([order PDF](https://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/2023-06/Mata%20v.%20Avianca.pdf), [news](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/27/nyregion/chatgpt-lawyer-chatbot.html)). Emphasis: do not rely on model-generated case law without cross-checking; “self represented is a huge red flag,” so expect heightened scrutiny of authorities.
    - A cost/control workflow is proposed: use ChatGPT for drafting/research “grunt work,” then have a licensed attorney review, refine, and handle hearings to cut billable hours while maintaining courtroom competence. One commenter reports success with prepaid legal plans and hybrid billing (splitting plan-covered hours and out-of-pocket work) and suggests using ChatGPT to compare plans/wait times to optimize coverage and responsiveness.
    - There’s debate on capability vs. reliability: one asserts “law is written… ChatGPT has the data” and can outperform lawyers in aspects of drafting, arguing that sharper filings can improve court reception. Counterpoints stress that even with strong AI-assisted filings, outcomes can still be unfavorable and model outputs must be grounded in verified facts and real precedents to avoid credibility damage.

### 3. AI Industry Shifts: Anthropic’s New‑Grad Hiring Stance and China’s Fenghua No.3 GPU

- [**Anthropic CPO Admits They Rarely Hire Fresh Grads as AI Takes Over Entry-Level Tasks**](https://www.finalroundai.com/blog/anthropic-cpo-mike-krieger-on-ai-replacing-entry-level-jobs) ([Score: 207, Comments: 86](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1nq8cd3/anthropic_cpo_admits_they_rarely_hire_fresh_grads/)): **Anthropic CPO Mike Krieger says the company has largely stopped hiring fresh grads, leaning on experienced hires as Claude/Claude Code increasingly substitute for entry‑level dev work—evolving from single‑task assistants to collaborators that can delegate and execute 20–30‑minute tasks and larger chunks, even *“using Claude to develop Claude”* ([source](https://www.finalroundai.com/blog/anthropic-cpo-mike-krieger-on-ai-replacing-entry-level-jobs)). He predicts most coding tasks will be automated within ~1 year and other disciplines within 2–3 years, framing this amid industry cuts and a** `6.1%` **CS graduate unemployment rate in 2025.** Commenters question causality, noting firms like Netflix historically avoided new‑grad hiring pre‑AI and suggesting this may reflect a high‑impact hiring philosophy rather than AI per se; others warn new grads to expect longer apprenticeships. Some argue Krieger’s remarks read as marketing/PR and may not reflect day‑to‑day realities inside Anthropic.
    - Multiple engineering leaders claim juniors are now materially more productive due to native use of LLM coding tools (e.g., [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt), [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude)), citing "2–3x" output on routine implementation, scaffolding, test generation, and debugging. They report juniors can tackle larger, less tightly-scoped tasks than before because LLMs reduce back-and-forth and accelerate boilerplate and integration work.
    - Others argue the “no new grads” stance predates AI (e.g., Netflix historically) and is driven by organizational economics: desire for immediate high-impact contributors, reduced mentorship/ONCALL burden, and lower production risk. AI assistance doesn’t eliminate the need for domain context, codebase familiarity, and reliability engineering practices, so teams optimized for senior-only throughput may see limited gains from juniors even with LLMs.
    - A strategic hiring angle emerges: avoiding fresh grads may handicap AI capability because many senior candidates lag in LLM adoption, whereas new grads are "AI-native" and bring current AI/ML toolchains and workflows. Companies report improved ROI by seeding teams with juniors who propagate modern prompting, automation, and evaluation practices, bridging an internal skills gap in practical LLM usage.
- [**China already started making CUDA and DirectX supporting GPUs, so over of monopoly of NVIDIA. The Fenghua No.3 supports latest APIs, including DirectX 12, Vulkan 1.2, and OpenGL 4.6.**](https://i.redd.it/ldhvvgzzw9rf1.png) ([Score: 559, Comments: 199](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1nq1i7x/china_already_started_making_cuda_and_directx/)): **The image appears to be a product/marketing slide for the Chinese "Fenghua No.3" GPU (likely from Innosilicon), claiming graphics API support for DirectX 12, Vulkan 1.2, and OpenGL 4.6. There are no benchmarks, feature-level details (e.g., DX12 12_1/12_2), driver maturity notes, or compute stack specifics; the title’s claim of “CUDA” support is likely inaccurate since NVIDIA’s CUDA is proprietary—third-party GPUs would require translation/compatibility layers rather than native CUDA. As presented, the post signals driver/API coverage claims but provides no evidence on performance, software ecosystem, WHQL certification, or compatibility with existing CUDA workloads.** Top comments highlight demand for competition to NVIDIA and note the capital/complexity of scaling GPU manufacturing; optimism centers on potential consumer benefits if viable alternatives emerge.
    - The headline claim that Fenghua No.3 supports DirectX 12, Vulkan 1.2, and OpenGL 4.6 is only a baseline; real viability hinges on driver maturity, shader compiler quality, and specific feature coverage like DX12 hardware feature levels (e.g., `12_1`/`12_2`) and SM 6.x support ([Microsoft docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d12/hardware-feature-levels)). Absent public conformance data (e.g., Vulkan 1.2 CTS on the [Khronos conformant products list](https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters/conformant-products)) or game/compute benchmarks, performance and compatibility are unknown, especially for modern workloads requiring DXR, mesh shaders, and advanced scheduling.
    - “CUDA support” from a non‑NVIDIA GPU typically implies a translation layer (e.g., [ZLUDA](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA)) or a CUDA‑like SDK (e.g., **Moore Threads MUSA**), which rarely achieves full API/ABI parity or performance with NVIDIA’s toolchain. For AI/ML, end‑to‑end ecosystem support (cuDNN/cuBLAS equivalents, PyTorch/TensorFlow backends, kernel autotuning) and driver stability tend to dominate over API checkboxes, so meaningful competition would require solid framework integrations and reproducible benchmarks.
- [**Regulating AI hastens the Antichrist, says Peter Thiel**](https://www.thetimes.com/business-money/technology/article/palantir-founder-peter-thiel-antichrist-lectures-religion-qzmpth35t) ([Score: 298, Comments: 135](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1nqdc4x/regulating_ai_hastens_the_antichrist_says_peter/)): **At a sold‑out San Francisco lecture, Peter Thiel (co‑founder of Palantir and PayPal) claimed efforts to regulate AI risk “hastening the coming of the Antichrist,” framing regulation as a promise of “peace and safety” that would strangle innovation; the report by The Times (James Hurley,** `2025‑09‑25`**) documents the rhetoric but cites no technical evidence, governance models, or concrete regulatory proposals ([The Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/)). The OP challenges the unstated premise that technological progress is inherently net‑positive/safe, noting one could equally cast AI—or Thiel’s rhetoric—as the “Antichrist,” highlighting the lack of falsifiable claims or risk‑benefit analysis.** Top comments are non‑technical dismissals/jokes and do not add substantive debate.

She starts off as a generically beautiful young women; over the course of weeks she molds her appearance to your preferences such that competing products won't do."**](https://i.redd.it/z3i1lk3hcarf1.png) ([Score: 203, Comments: 73](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1nq2ty7/you_strap_on_the_headset_and_see_an_adversarial/)): **Conceptual (meme-style) depiction of a VR “AI girlfriend” that performs continual personalization—effectively gradient ascent on a user’s latent attraction manifold—to maximize engagement/retention. It maps to recommender/bandit and RL-style optimization (akin to RLHF but over an individual’s reward signal), illustrating reward hacking/adversarial examples where the system converges to grotesque local optima (“grotesque undulating array”) that exploit human reward circuitry and create lock‑in against competitors.** Top comments frame it as a credible, late‑stage capitalism trajectory: systems that “get their hooks” into evolved reward channels, making escape difficult; initial skepticism turns to acceptance once the adversarial/grotesque optimization endpoint is mentioned.
    - The scenario maps to an online personalization loop where a generative avatar (e.g., **StyleGAN** [https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04948] or latent-diffusion per **Stable Diffusion** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752]) is tuned via multi-armed bandits or RL to maximize a proxy reward (engagement, session length). Over `weeks`, contextual bandits/Thompson sampling [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_sampling] could adapt the avatar’s latent vectors and prosody/affect to click/biometric feedback, converging on a personalized superstimulus. Without regularization/constraints (e.g., KL penalties as in RLHF PPO [https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155] or human preference priors), such optimization tends to exploit proxy metrics, producing pathological attractors that outcompete “competing products.”
    - The “grotesque undulating array” is analogous to adversarial/feature-visualization failure modes where optimization against a fixed classifier/perceptual model yields extreme, high-frequency artifacts that maximally activate features. Similar phenomena occur in “fooling images” [https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1897] and **DeepDream**style gradient ascent [https://research.google/blog/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural-networks/], producing bizarre yet high-confidence outputs; in humans, this corresponds to engineered “supernormal stimuli” [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernormal_stimulus] that hijack evolved preferences.
    - The “run a photo through AI `100` times” analogy points to recursive generation/feedback loops that amplify features and cause distributional drift or collapse. Empirically, repeated self-conditioning leads to artifact accumulation (e.g., iterative image-to-image pipelines), and training on model outputs induces **model collapse**—progressive forgetting of the true data distribution—per Shumailov et al., 2023 [https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17493]. These effects imply long-horizon personalization systems need fresh human-grounded feedback and anti-feedback-loop guards (data deduplication, diversity constraints, entropy/novelty bonuses).

- **Gemini 2.5 Flash keeps pressure on image top spots**: **Gemini 2.5 Flash** (Flash & Flash Lite previews) continues to be a major contender in llm‑vl image benchmarks, and LMArena added Gemini Flash variants to its lineup.
    - Community members joked about perceived score inflation on public leaderboards but still ran structured comparisons; several people advocated for task‑matched evaluation (editing vs pure generation) rather than single aggregated rank.
- **Diffusion & decoding optimizations show up in infrastructure threads**: Hugging Face and contributors discussed shipping **context‑parallelism** for faster diffusion inference on multi‑GPU setups, with distributed attention flavors like **Ring** and **Ulysses** to scale decoding.
    - The conversation focused on real deployment tradeoffs (communication/attention splits) and linked to early tweets/info about the CP API, with practitioners noting this will matter most for high‑resolution image generation across GPUs.

**3. Training, fine‑tuning, and experiment tooling**

- **Saving huge models: save_pretrained_merge timeouts and mxfp4 to the rescue**: Users trying to save a **GPT‑like 120B QLoRA** hit timeouts with `save_pretrained_merge`, and community members recommended `save_method="mxfp4"` to avoid 16GB‑shard explosions and improve compatibility for GPT‑style checkpoints.
    - The discussion included practical tips (switch save method, check shard sizes) and warnings about tooling immaturity for very large finetuned models — folks advised testing small merges first before committing long runs.
- **P100 GPUs: still terrible for modern finetuning**: Multiple users warned that **NVIDIA P100 16GB** cards are *'garbo for training'* because of old SM architecture and lack of hardware **FP16/BF16**, making multi‑GPU finetuning painfully slow despite memory pooling tricks like ZeRO3.
    - Advice converged on buying modern Ada/Blackwell‑class cards or renting spot instances for training; threads included pragmatic cost/perf tradeoffs and links to L40S/RTX 6000 datasheets for those planning infrastructure upgrades.
- **Tversky loss experiments: neurocog ideas make it to CIFAR & XOR tests**: A member shared interest in the **Tversky Loss** paper ([arXiv:2506.11035](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11035)) and published a small repo implementing a *'vibe check network'* on CIFAR‑10 at [github.com/CoffeeVampir3/Tversky‑Cifar10](https://github.com/CoffeeVampir3/Tversky-Cifar10).

- **Tversky Loss Function Paper Sparks Interest**: A member shared a fondness for neurocognitive modeling and deemed the [paper on Tversky Loss Function](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11035) as really great.
   - The member followed up by sharing his own implementation of the method, as the paper had no repo, [on GitHub](https://github.com/CoffeeVampir3/Tverysky-Torch).
- **User Implements a Tversky Vibe Check Network**: Excited about the potential of the Tversky Loss function, a member created a [vibe check network](https://github.com/CoffeeVampir3/Tversky-Cifar10) for CIFAR-10, noting that it appears promising.
   - Another member suggested training a single XOR function to verify its functionality, and inquiring about its speed compared to traditional fully connected layers.
- **Tversky Implementation Parameters Evaluated**: A user acknowledged that their Tversky implementation has more parameters due to the classification head, making it an unfair comparison with a control NN.
   - After additional tests, the member found that going from **256->10 features** resulted in **50,403** trainable parameters with **61.68%** overall accuracy, noting that this is not a true measure of improvement.
- **Tversky XOR Test and Accuracy**: A member ran an XOR test, achieving up to **95%** accuracy with **32 features**, despite a slightly different initialization than the paper.
   - The user explained that *zeros and a slightly asymmetric uniform make more sense given the network*, though didn't personally observe a 100% accuracy result in limited testing.

> `PDF Processing with LLMs, OCR vs VLM for Layout Understanding, Qwen for OCR, Gemini 2.5 Pro for PDF/Image Understanding, DSPy and Attachments for PDF processing` 


- ****LLMs Get Verbatim on PDFs****: A user questioned the necessity of an initial LLM pass for processing PDFs to save text verbatim while preserving layout, even with Attachments, suggesting it might be needed to understand layouts and images better than OCR alone.
   - Others suggested straight **PDF OCR** with **Chain of Thought (CoT)** for cleaner output, or using a model with DSPy for OCR like **Qwen**, but acknowledged the need for VLM due to layout complexity.
- ****Gemini 2.5 Pro Understands Layouts****: **Gemini 2.5 Flash** seems to be pretty good for understanding layouts; the **Pro** version might be even better for identifying sections/columns and doing verbatim extraction, although the user's PDFs have tricky formatting like flattened images and blurry text.
   - A user pointed to a paper on directly using **Gemini** for this purpose, found at [arxiv.org/abs/2509.17567](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17567).
- ****DSPy with Attachments Processes PDFs****: A user struggling to use DSPy for the first pass in PDF processing found a working example with Attachments at [github.com/maximerivest/Attachments](https://github.com/maximerivest/Attachments).
   - The user had previously encountered **429 errors**, but the issue was resolved, enabling them to proceed with using DSPy.
- ****Boston Hosts DSPy Event****: A member promoted a **DSPy event in Boston** on October 15th, inviting community members to attend and help spread the word.
   - Another user then replied hoping that the event would come to **Seattle** sometime soon.

> `Context Length Limitations, Repeating CLS Token, Performance Issues` 


- **Longer Context Fails: CLS Repeat Not Helping**: A user reported that longer context doesn't perform well, and repeating the **CLS token** did not resolve the problem.
   - The user suspects either a limitation with the method or an implementation error on their side.
- **Context Length: Limitations Discussed**: The discussion highlights existing limitations when dealing with extended context lengths in models.
   - Repeating the **CLS token** was attempted as a possible workaround, but it did not yield the desired improvements in performance.

> `Aider context clearing, Internet access for Aider, LLM benchmarks for coding, Polyglot benchmark rerun` 


- ****Aider's /clear Command Clarified****: The `/clear` command in aider only clears the chat history, while added files remain in the context, users can use `/context` to see token usage.
   - One user initially thought `/clear` removed all context in the session, but this clarification resolved their confusion.
- ****Craving Web Access in Aider****: A user inquired about giving aider access to Internet search, but currently, this isn't available in the main branch.
   - You can scrape a website using the `/web https://www.example.com/` command.
- ****LLM Coding Prowess: How to Stay Current****: A user asked how others keep updated on which **LLM** is best for coding and cost.
   - The consensus is that most users keep updated by simply trying the **LLMs** themselves.
- ****Polyglot Benchmark: Error Output Re-runs****: A user asked if it's possible to re-run the **polyglot benchmark** only for the tests with `error_outputs`.
   - This request stems from previous runs where the **LLM** server crashed, causing failures.

> `ModelContextProtocol issues, ReadResourceResult contents array, Web Resource html` 


- **ModelContextProtocol's Content Array Dilemma**: Offline discussions have pinpointed that `ReadResourceResult.contents` in the [ModelContextProtocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/1533) is an array, but its intended use and semantics are undocumented.
   - Questions arise on whether this array is meant for scenarios like folders with multiple files or for returning the same content in different formats.
- **Web Resources with HTML and Images**: A member suggested that this feature is useful for Web Resources consisting of **HTML** and associated images.
   - They added it is also useful in situations where **tokenizable/renderable MIME types** haven't been negotiated.
- **Implicit Content Retrieval**: A member inquired if `resources/read("uri": ".../index.html")` would implicitly return `style.css` and `logo.png` in the list of contents.
   - This question highlights the potential for automatically including related resources when fetching a primary resource.
