# AI Twitter Recap

**Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (“nano-banana”) dominates image editing**

- **Model reveal, capabilities, availability**: The anonymous “nano-banana” on community arenas was confirmed as **Gemini‑2.5‑Flash‑Image‑Preview** by Google DeepMind. It delivers state-of-the-art image editing and generation with standout strengths in **character consistency**, **targeted natural-language edits**, **multi-image composition**, and accurate text rendering. It’s live in the Gemini app, Google AI Studio/API, and surfaced early across eval sites ([@GoogleDeepMind](https://twitter.com/GoogleDeepMind/status/1960341906790957283), [@sundarpichai](https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/1960342316415087049), [@Google](https://twitter.com/Google/status/1960342356881723469), [docs](https://twitter.com/_philschmid/status/1960344026437026056), [pricing](https://twitter.com/omarsar0/status/1960344569356431634)).
- **Benchmarks and usage at scale**: On the Image Edit Arena, Gemini 2.5 Flash Image leads by an unprecedented **~170–180 Elo** against the next best, with >5M votes across two weeks and >2.5M votes on this model alone—the largest margin in Arena history. It now ranks #1 for image editing and #1 or top-tier for text-to-image in community leaderboards ([@lmarena_ai](https://twitter.com/lmarena_ai/status/1960343469370884462), [reveal](https://twitter.com/lmarena_ai/status/1960342813599760516), [usage spike](https://twitter.com/cdngdev/status/1960355432037560697), [Artificial Analysis](https://twitter.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/1960388401401880898)). Cost is cited as **$30 per 1M output tokens** (about 1,290 tokens per image, i.e., **~$0.039/image**) ([@_philschmid](https://twitter.com/_philschmid/status/1960344024151199765), [@andrew_n_carr](https://twitter.com/andrew_n_carr/status/1960345460067148128)). Multiple demos highlight multi-turn conversational editing, consistent persona re-rendering, and implicit “world knowledge” in visual edits ([@skirano](https://twitter.com/skirano/status/1960343968320737397), [@omarsar0](https://twitter.com/omarsar0/status/1960347789637878171)).
- **Ecosystem availability**: The model is already integrated on third-party platforms and leaderboards (e.g., Yupp, LMArena battle mode, OpenRouter as a launch partner), with community prompting guides rolling out ([@yupp_ai](https://twitter.com/yupp_ai/status/1960345648424800750), [@xanderatallah](https://twitter.com/xanderatallah/status/1960358164693438934), [@OfficialLoganK](https://twitter.com/OfficialLoganK/status/1960343135436906754)).

**New models and open-source releases**

- **Nous Research Hermes 4 (open weights)**: Hybrid “reasoning” models focused on steerability, low refusals, and strong math/coding/STEM benchmarks. Available on Hugging Face and OpenRouter, with “thinking” mode toggles via headers/template kwargs ([@NousResearch](https://twitter.com/NousResearch/status/1960416954457710982), [weights](https://twitter.com/Teknium1/status/1960420619620901135), [OpenRouter](https://twitter.com/OpenRouterAI/status/1960436262923592065), [toggle](https://twitter.com/jon_durbin/status/1960434806740717720)).
- **NVIDIA Nemotron Nano 9B V2 (reasoning small model)**: A hybrid Mamba‑Transformer, 128k context model trained by NVIDIA (not Llama-derived), released under the **NVIDIA Open Model License** (no Llama restrictions). Supports reasoning/non-reasoning modes (system “/no_think”), reported as top-performing **<10B** model on one leaderboard; NVIDIA also released a **6.6T-token pretraining subset** on Hugging Face ([@dl_weekly](https://twitter.com/dl_weekly/status/1960321337248944130), [@ArtificialAnlys](https://twitter.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/1960504310309249045), [NVIDIA blog](https://twitter.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/1960504316550373657)).
- **InternVL3.5 (VLMs)**: First VLMs built off OpenAI’s gpt‑oss line are out, with a diverse set of 32 models spanning pretraining, finetuning, and alignment, using either gpt‑oss or Qwen3 as the LLM backbone ([@mervenoyann](https://twitter.com/mervenoyann/status/1960298636610326564)).
- **Ollama v0.11.7**: Adds DeepSeek v3.1 support (hybrid “thinking”) across the app/CLI/API/SDKs with Turbo mode in preview ([@ollama](https://twitter.com/ollama/status/1960463433515852144)).
- **Apple Silicon local stack**: “Osaurus” is a lightweight (~7MB) MLX-based Apple Silicon-native LLM server claiming ~20% faster than Ollama; community is porting multiple small models to MLX ([@geekbb](https://twitter.com/geekbb/status/1960166766338023759), [@LiMzba](https://twitter.com/LiMzba/status/1960277996172149103)).
- Also of note: Liquid AI’s LFM2‑VL series ([@dl_weekly](https://twitter.com/dl_weekly/status/1960387356889928174)) and a strong French finetune of LFM2 by students using FFT+merging ([@maximelabonne](https://twitter.com/maximelabonne/status/1960288489838092456)).

**Agents, APIs, and developer tooling**

- **Claude for Chrome (research preview)**: Anthropic is piloting a browser-integrated actioning agent for 1,000 users. Emphasis is on safety—especially prompt injection defenses—prior to broader rollout ([@AnthropicAI](https://twitter.com/AnthropicAI/status/1960417002469908903), [safety note](https://twitter.com/AnthropicAI/status/1960417004202156391)).
- **OpenAI API changes**: Assistants API is officially deprecated in favor of the **Responses API** (sunsets Aug 26, 2026). Responses now carries code interpreter, persistent conversations, MCP, and computer use; with GPT‑5, “reasoning tokens” are preserved between turns. Web search in Responses gets domain filtering, source reporting, and a price cut to **$10/1K calls** (from $25) ([@OpenAIDevs](https://twitter.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1960409187122602172), [pricing update](https://twitter.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1960425260576334274)).
- **Agent architecture and evaluation**: Cline argues many 2023 patterns—multi-agent orchestration, codebase-indexed RAG, and instruction overloading—often underperform vs simpler designs today ([thread](https://twitter.com/cline/status/1960175630907306325), [blog](https://twitter.com/cline/status/1960175691212968289)). TransluceAI’s Docent alpha automates behavior analysis at scale (reward hacking, instruction violations), with early testers from major labs and evaluations orgs ([launch](https://twitter.com/TransluceAI/status/1960411239919837654)). Weave+Tavily released recipes for traceable, current research agents ([Weave](https://twitter.com/weave_wb/status/1960428416236445931)). LangGraph Studio’s update improves interactive debugging and tracing UX ([@LangChainAI](https://twitter.com/LangChainAI/status/1960442209918218491)). Weaviate’s Elysia offers an “agentic RAG” UI with dynamic displays beyond text ([@weaviate_io](https://twitter.com/weaviate_io/status/1960335442521346220)). Beam ships an OSS “decorator-to-serverless” framework ([@_avichawla](https://twitter.com/_avichawla/status/1960228287516684505)).

**Training, RL, and optimization**

- **GRPO demystified with code**: Clear walkthroughs of GRPO applied to train Qwen 2.5 to play 2048, with runnable code and an explainer video ([@jayendra_ram](https://twitter.com/jayendra_ram/status/1960157842620498107)). Community quips that “RL with LLMs is just massaging your KV cache to fit in memory” capture the practitioner reality ([@finbarrtimbers](https://twitter.com/finbarrtimbers/status/1960177754655359110)).
- **RL frameworks snapshot**: A roundup contrasts verl (Ray/DataProto infra; SGLang integrated; scaled to 671B), AReal (Ant’s async RL), Nemo‑RL (NVIDIA; strong perf, later to adoption), and Zhipu’s Slime (SGLang/Megatron-optimized). On‑policy is cleaner, but off‑policy often wins in practice due to rollout/inference bottlenecks in post‑training ([summary](https://twitter.com/ZhihuFrontier/status/1960175371330208073)).
- **Long-context and compression**: Hugging Face Trainer now supports **context parallelism** for 100k+ sequence lengths ([@m_sirovatka](https://twitter.com/m_sirovatka/status/1960338030902096067)). vLLM’s LLM Compressor v0.7.0 adds transform support (QuIP, SpinQuant), mixed precision, better MoE handling (Llama‑4), and NVFP4/FP8 mixes ([@vllm_project](https://twitter.com/vllm_project/status/1960432740672921934)). Research/threads cover Adam’s scale invariance caveats via epsilon tuning ([@sedielem](https://twitter.com/sedielem/status/1960329585972641797)) and adaptive batching for comms efficiency (AdLoCo) ([@papers_anon](https://twitter.com/papers_anon/status/1960225989008748900)).
- **Data pipelines are evolving**: Trend from “more data with light filters” to aggressive LLM-based filtering + replay for longer training (FineWeb‑edu/HQ, DCLM), and now **LLM rephrasing** to extract more signal per sample (e.g., Nemotron‑CC, WRAP, REWIRE). Multi‑epoch training is back in favor with diminishing returns accepted ([@lvwerra](https://twitter.com/lvwerra/status/1960346415051247748)).

**Systems and infra notes**

- **Google TPUv7 architecture (Hot Chips)**: First public block diagram for TPUv7 (aka v6p/“ghostfish”): 8 stacks of HBM3e, 4 medium-size systolic arrays, **3D torus** scale-up to 9,216 devices. OCS reduces but does not eliminate failure-domain “blast radius” in 3D torus topologies ([@SemiAnalysis_](https://twitter.com/SemiAnalysis_/status/1960424664741634094)).
- **Platforms**: zml/llmd now runs on TPU with full prefill/decode paged attention and a single flag ([@steeve](https://twitter.com/steeve/status/1960333418467664332)); Hugging Face Diffusers deprecates Flax to go PyTorch-first ([@RisingSayak](https://twitter.com/RisingSayak/status/1960333842553897296)). Slurm support landed for H100/H200/B200 multi-node setups on Prime clusters ([@jannik_stra](https://twitter.com/jannik_stra/status/1960375622003196127)).

**Benchmarks and reasoning research**

- **Reasoning/math**: IneqMath adds judges, more data, local vLLM support, and a continually updated leaderboard; SOTA results now at 47% overall with GPT‑5 (medium, 30K) vs 23.5% for the best open model (gpt‑oss‑120B, 10K) ([@lupantech](https://twitter.com/lupantech/status/1960384184842879444)). Stanford’s UQ benchmark probes whether LLMs can solve curated unsolved problems across domains; some model solutions passed expert validation ([@Muennighoff](https://twitter.com/Muennighoff/status/1960391987917402509)). MIRAGE explores graph‑retrieval augmented multi-chain reasoning with interpretable KG chains and budget tuning ([@omarsar0](https://twitter.com/omarsar0/status/1960447282110980187)). A new interpretability result links neuron feature “overpacking” to adversarial fragility ([@GoodfireAI](https://twitter.com/GoodfireAI/status/1960378734852046859)). And a historical note: “scaling laws” discussions predate 2017/2020 work—see NIPS 1993’s learning curves and test error prediction ([@jxmnop](https://twitter.com/jxmnop/status/1960314100715528627)).

**Top tweets (by engagement)**

- **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (banana trifecta)**: Announcements and demos from Sundar Pichai and Google DeepMind drove massive engagement ([@sundarpichai](https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/1960340452604785008), [@GoogleDeepMind](https://twitter.com/GoogleDeepMind/status/1960341906790957283), [@googleaistudio](https://twitter.com/googleaistudio/status/1960344388560904213)).
- **Anthropic’s agentic push**: Claude for Chrome research preview, focused on safe browser actioning ([@AnthropicAI](https://twitter.com/AnthropicAI/status/1960417002469908903)).
- **Community validation**: Demis Hassabis calling Gemini 2.5 Image the best available model by a wide Elo margin ([@demishassabis](https://twitter.com/demishassabis/status/1960355658059891018)); Oriol Vinyals on usage and Arena virality ([@OriolVinyalsML](https://twitter.com/OriolVinyalsML/status/1960343791283433842)).
- **Reid Hoffman’s heuristic**: “10,000 prompts is the new 10,000 hours” captured the zeitgeist of practice-driven mastery ([@reidhoffman](https://twitter.com/reidhoffman/status/1960392913130541551)).
- **Scale AI x US Army**: Industry momentum continues with a **$99M** U.S. Army contract announcement ([@alexandr_wang](https://twitter.com/alexandr_wang/status/1960195704275743035)).

# AI Reddit Recap

## /r/LocalLlama + /r/localLLM Recap

### 1. Hermes 4 and VibeVoice Releases; Gemma3 270M Pretraining Tutorial

- [**Nous Research presents Hermes 4**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1n0us6p/nous_research_presents_hermes_4/) ([Score: 252, Comments: 55](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1n0us6p/nous_research_presents_hermes_4/)): **Nous Research announces Hermes 4, an open-source release with artifacts on the [HF collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/NousResearch/hermes-4-collection-68a731bfd452e20816725728), a project site at [hermes4.nousresearch.com](http://hermes4.nousresearch.com/), a public [chat UI](https://chat.nousresearch.com/), and an accompanying [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18255). A shared results graphic claims Hermes 4 is SOTA versus popular closed and open models specifically on a “values conformance”/alignment metric, marketed as achieving this "without censorship" ([scorecard image](https://preview.redd.it/fwpgqj38xelf1.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=158d1e267646abaff1aadffaee19144b17e0ce56)).** Commenters question the continued choice of a Llama 3 base for Hermes 4 (as with Hermes 3), seeking rationale versus alternative backbones; otherwise, reception is broadly positive with emphasis on the alignment/SOTA claims.
    - A shared screenshot claims Hermes 4 attains **SOTA** on "conforming to your values" versus both closed- and open-source models, explicitly emphasizing operation "without censorship." This suggests an alignment/instruction-tuning focus that maximizes preference adherence while minimizing refusals, though the thread does not provide concrete benchmark names or scores (screenshot: https://preview.redd.it/fwpgqj38xelf1.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=158d1e267646abaff1aadffaee19144b17e0ce56).
    - There’s debate about the base model: a commenter notes Hermes/Nous 4 appears to use a Llama 3 family backbone again (as with Nous 3), questioning why Llama 3 was selected twice. Another commenter speculates "Hermes 4 gpt-oss 120b," but no definitive parameter count or base identification is provided, leaving uncertainty whether it’s Llama 3/3.1 or a "gpt-oss 120B"-class foundation.
    - Availability: Hermes 4 is already exposed on **OpenRouter** via **Nebius AI Studio**, indicating immediate API access for testing and integration. Links: provider page https://openrouter.ai/provider/nebius and deployment screenshot https://preview.redd.it/cz3q399y5flf1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=90e1c05ccda2152760c836067a10881c353f0196.
- [**Microsoft VibeVoice TTS : Open-Sourced, Supports 90 minutes speech, 4 distinct speakers at a time**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1n0bhd7/microsoft_vibevoice_tts_opensourced_supports_90/) ([Score: 309, Comments: 98](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1n0bhd7/microsoft_vibevoice_tts_opensourced_supports_90/)): **Microsoft open‑sourced VibeVoice ([GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/VibeVoice), [demo](https://youtu.be/uIvx_nhPjl0?si=_pzMrAG2VcE5F7qJ)), a neural TTS system in** `1.5B` **and** `7B` **variants that supports long‑form synthesis up to** `~90 min` **per generation and native multi‑speaker mixing of** `up to 4` **concurrent voices (also usable in single‑speaker audiobook mode). Early user testing reports strong prosody/expressiveness and practical long‑context generation suited for podcast/audiobook workflows.** A tester on Windows 11 with an RTX 4090 reports the `7B` model uses ~`18–19 GB` VRAM for the model (~`22/24 GB` total) and runs at ~`0.5×` real‑time (≈2 min compute per 1 min audio), with quality more expressive than Chatterbox‑TTS; voice cloning quality improves with ~`30 s` reference clips. Other comments note English/Mandarin support, a `0.5B` model “coming soon,” and some uncertainty about built‑in cloning capabilities.
    - User benchmark on Windows 11 with an RTX 4090 (24GB) running the 7B model: total VRAM usage `~22/24GB` (with `~3.5GB` system overhead, implying `~18–19GB` for the model), and generation speed roughly `2 minutes` to synthesize `1 minute` of audio (`~0.5x` real-time). Confirms it fits a 24GB card but isn’t fast yet, suggesting room for optimization.
    - Quality and features: perceived as more expressive than Chatterbox-TTS; voice cloning was “pretty good” with `5–10s` samples and likely “very good” with recommended `~30s` .wav prompts. Supports a single-speaker mode for audiobook-style output in addition to the multi-speaker capability.
    - Capabilities/variants noted: reported support for English and Mandarin; mention of a `0.5B` model “coming soon.” One commenter questioned whether voice cloning is officially supported, while another reported working cloning with adequate sample length—suggesting possible confusion over feature availability or usage requirements.
- [**I pre-trained Gemma3 270m entirely from scratch**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1n0haub/i_pretrained_gemma3_270m_entirely_from_scratch/) ([Score: 240, Comments: 27](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1n0haub/i_pretrained_gemma3_270m_entirely_from_scratch/)): **Creator demonstrates end-to-end pretraining of a Gemma 3** `270M`**parameter model from scratch, covering dataset loading, tokenization, IO-pair creation, architecture build, pretraining, and inference, with lecture-note GIF and a walkthrough video ([YouTube](https://youtu.be/bLDlwcl6hbA?si=1bxlObPOTw2n1TPB)). Training used** `1× A100` **on Colab for** `~60k` **iterations (≈**`3 hours`**) on [TinyStories](https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories) (**`~2M` **short stories); code/notebook shared via [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OHPQf3iM9RD9g2wZRTj7nf8fs3pgbnF4?usp=sharing). Reported outcome: *“decent results.”*** Commenters ask for concrete setup details; OP clarifies hardware, dataset, and iterations. Others view it as a practical starting point for learning to build and train small LLMs from scratch.
    - Training setup/perf: a ~`270M`parameter Gemma3 variant was pre-trained from scratch on a single **A100** (Colab), running `60k` iterations in about `~3 hours`, yielding *“decent results.”* While no eval metrics were reported, this gives a rough small-scale pretrain throughput reference for instructional runs on commodity cloud GPUs.
    - Data and reproducibility: Used **TinyStories** (https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories) with `~2,000,000` short-story rows (one story per row), a dataset commonly used for training small LMs on simple compositional text. The exact tokenization, batch size, and total tokens processed weren’t specified, but the full Colab notebook is shared for replication: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OHPQf3iM9RD9g2wZRTj7nf8fs3pgbnF4?usp=sharing.

### 2. Jet-Nemotron 53x Speedups and Nano-Banana Image Edit Benchmarks

- [**LLM speedup breakthrough? 53x faster generation and 6x prefilling from NVIDIA**](https://i.redd.it/g8lwztnlfclf1.png) ([Score: 941, Comments: 146](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1n0iho2/llm_speedup_breakthrough_53x_faster_generation/)): **NVIDIA’s “Jet‑Nemotron” (per the image and linked paper) claims major inference efficiency gains via Post Neural Architecture Search (PostNAS), reporting** `53.6×` **higher generation throughput and** `6.1×` **faster prefilling versus baselines like Qwen3 and Llama3.2, while stating no accuracy loss. The figure benchmarks throughput/prefill speed against competing LLMs; source paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.15884v1 and image: https://i.redd.it/g8lwztnlfclf1.png.** Commenters are skeptical about real‑world adoption and ask whether these speedups translate beyond NVIDIA GPUs, especially to CPU inference; validation by major labs is a noted concern.
    - A commenter flags a discrepancy between headline numbers and end-to-end results: despite claims of `53×` faster generation and `6×` faster prefilling, Table 15 reportedly shows only about `~7×` real-world inference speedup. They also note significant KV cache reductions of `10×–60×` and minimal slowdown for long-context decoding, which could materially change memory footprint and throughput under long sequences.
    - Training cost is debated: Table 12 is cited as requiring roughly `20,000` H100 GPU-hours to train a `~2B` model, which seems at odds with the claim that training is “not as expensive as SOTA.” One comparison point raised is Qwen-2.5-1B, which the commenter believes may have used substantially fewer H100-hours (exact figures not confirmed).
    - Deployment implications are questioned: if the `10–40×` speedups also hold on CPU inference, larger models could become practical without paying the NVIDIA memory premium. Commenters also ask about ecosystem readiness—e.g., GGUF format support—and propose testing an `~8B` model (quantized from Qwen-2.5-7B) to probe whether the technique scales with model size.

Competing models from groups like Black Forest and OpenAI rank below it; the post title frames this as a major advance in image editing.** Commenters question astroturfing/spam around the model, argue it’s less useful because it’s closed-source, and report aggressive safety filters (e.g., edits blocked for any image containing children, including historical photos).
    - Several commenters challenge the value of a closed model without transparent evaluation, noting claims like *"Claude and that Google video model are at least* `3x` *better"* but lacking comparable benchmarks. For an image-editing model, they suggest standardized metrics (e.g., mask IoU/precision-recall for edit localization, identity preservation, LPIPS/SSIM/PSNR for fidelity) and public datasets/protocols to verify the purported jump in quality and speed.
    - Reports of "extremely censored" behavior indicate aggressive, context-insensitive safety filters: *"I can't edit any picture with a child…"* implies any detected minor in-frame triggers a blanket refusal regardless of the edit type or historical context. This likely reflects conservative age-detection and policy short-circuiting that raise false positives; technically, a more granular risk model (per-edit intent classification, uncertainty-aware thresholds, and human-in-the-loop review modes) would reduce overblocking while maintaining compliance.
    - Open-source availability is cited as a hard requirement: *"Useless if it’s not open source"*. From a technical integration standpoint, open weights enable on-prem inference (privacy/latency), custom safety policy tuning, domain-specific fine-tuning, and reproducible versioning; closed APIs introduce vendor lock-in, opaque model updates, shifting guardrails, and rate/usage limits that complicate reliable deployment and auditing.

### 1. Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (Nano Banana) Release and Benchmarks

- [**Nano Banana is live**](https://i.redd.it/iv1l6a73hdlf1.jpeg) ([Score: 705, Comments: 148](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1n0n1n7/nano_banana_is_live/)): **Screenshot of a post by Sundar Pichai announcing a new image-editing capability in the Gemini app focused on subject/likeness preservation across contexts. The demo shows** `4` **edits of the same dog (“Jeffree”)—surfing, cowboy, superhero, chef—while keeping identity consistent, indicating a reference-based, subject-consistent generation/editing model; the title hints at a codename (“Nano Banana”), but no architecture/size or on-device vs. cloud details are provided.** Commenters claim it’s state-of-the-art for identity fidelity in consumer tools (e.g., “#1 in Lmarena by far”) and ask whether this is a major leap or just an incremental upgrade.
    - Benchmark standing: A commenter reports Nano Banana is **#1 on the Lmarena leaderboard**, implying strong head-to-head performance versus contemporaries (likely via preference/arena-style evaluations). Screenshot reference: https://preview.redd.it/ibnaoyrkhdlf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d399114be0f588533d46c748bfcbe3153652cde.
    - Editing quality/capability: Users highlight that Nano Banana achieves **editing results other models can’t match** at comparable quality, suggesting improved edit fidelity and instruction adherence in image editing workflows. Example output: https://preview.redd.it/da5jnvykndlf1.png?width=1033&format=png&auto=webp&s=095225a050fb5f8a333ee99025b70d84f1dd9b81.
    - Performance/latency: Feedback notes the **generation speed is “insane,”** hinting at significantly lower latency and potentially real-time or near-instant high-quality image synthesis for editing tasks compared to prior models. This suggests substantial inference efficiency gains (e.g., faster diffusion steps or optimized runtime), though no exact timings were provided.

This suggests an early/preview rollout of Gemini 2.5 Flash’s image editing/vision capability; commenters report it’s already usable in the Gemini app (ask 2.5 Flash to edit an image) and note an update that it’s now exposed in Vertex AI API as well. Related screenshots: primary image https://i.redd.it/i2d190ga3dlf1.jpeg, extra https://preview.redd.it/puc3xnpr5dlf1.jpeg?width=1869&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=49fe8352fb9b884bc43bccd1ae8dbd8bdffdb37b. The title’s “Nano Banana” appears to be community shorthand/codename tied to this rollout.** Comments show mild confusion on discoverability ("where, what am I looking at?") and whether this is a rebrand vs. a genuinely new capability, but consensus notes real availability in the Gemini app and Vertex AI.
    - Early signals of rollout via the consumer app: a user notes that asking **Gemini 2.5 Flash** to perform image editing appears to invoke the **“Nano Banana”** capability, implying silent server-side model/tool routing for vision-edit tasks. This suggests Google may be auto-selecting a lighter image-editing path behind the 2.5 Flash entry point rather than exposing a separate model toggle.
    - Deployment to cloud APIs: another user reports it’s "now available in **Vertex AI** API" with a supporting screenshot [link](https://preview.redd.it/puc3xnpr5dlf1.jpeg?width=1869&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=49fe8352fb9b884bc43bccd1ae8dbd8bdffdb37b). If accurate, this indicates programmatic access via Vertex endpoints, enabling integration/testing beyond the Gemini app.

The board ranks image editing/generation models by aggregated crowd preferences and lists orgs/licenses, indicating Gemini’s sizeable performance margin under this evaluation setup.** Commenters emphasize the unusually large Elo gap—saying the distance from #1 to #2 is about the same as #2 to #10—and characterize it as “a whole lap,” alongside praise for Google.
    - Leaderboard signal: Commenters note a large Elo gap on LMArena—“the distance in elo scores between n° 1 and n° 2 is nearly the same as n° 2 and n° 10.” This implies `#1` has a substantial performance margin over the field, suggesting a strong, measurable lead rather than a marginal win.
    - Hands-on benchmarks vs contemporaries: A tester reports **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image** shows markedly better prompt adherence than **Imagen 4**, with photorealism surpassing **Imagen** and **Seedream** in their trials. For image editing, it consistently outperforms **Qwen Image**, **Flux Kontext**, and **GPT Image**, calling the results *“game-changing”* for most edits.
    - Limitations/regressions: It performs poorly on style transfer compared to **2.0 Flash Image** (e.g., watercolor style), indicating a potential regression for style changes. Text rendering lags **GPT-Image-1** and it cannot reliably generate multi-panel comic pages; sample comparison provided by the tester: https://preview.redd.it/qfqhnf23ldlf1.jpeg?width=2160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f22c7bd572572cb1a42aa3a4061f85d5b5e718ba.

The promo graphic shows benchmark leads on image-editing tasks and diverse edited variants, and notes availability via free trial and the Gemini API (see docs: https://ai.google.dev/). Core pitch is high-fidelity, instruction-following edits with consistent character identity across outputs.** Commenters note the irony that outputs still carry a watermark despite the model’s editing focus; sentiment ranges from “good but overhyped” to claims that Gemini now surpasses ChatGPT overall.
    - Users flag that the model’s headline feature—image editing—still outputs with a visible watermark. This limits production use (brand/marketing assets typically need clean exports) and suggests the provider is prioritizing provenance/safety tagging over unrestricted editing; until a watermark-off option or C2PA-only metadata is offered, workflows will require post-processing to remove artifacts.
    - Commenters argue the proper comparison set is **Midjourney** (image generation/editing) rather than **OpenAI/ChatGPT** (LLMs). Technical evaluation should center on edit locality/fidelity (masking, prompt-conditioning), render quality under edits, latency/throughput, and per-image pricing—not conversational benchmarks.
    - Early community signal indicates positive sentiment; a [**Yupp.ai**](http://yupp.ai/) leaderboard is referenced for crowd-sourced rankings: https://www.reddit.com/r/yupp_ai/s/AHFeINoARf. While subjective, such leaderboards can surface comparative strengths/weaknesses (e.g., consistency on complex edits) in the absence of standardized quantitative benchmarks.

    - Anecdotal report: The model succeeded on image-editing tasks that other generators failed at when supplied with reference images. This suggests strong image-conditional editing/visual prompting capabilities and better consistency under example-guided control. It implies improvements in reference-based style/content transfer versus prior SOTA.
    - A commenter asks why Midjourney (MJ) isn’t represented in the benchmarks. This highlights a common gap where closed, non-academic systems are omitted, limiting apples-to-apples comparisons. Clear disclosure of which models/versions are included and test setup would make the “dominates” claim more actionable.
    - One commenter questions whether it’s worth keeping up due to weekly SOTA claims followed by fast followers. This underscores that benchmark leads can be short-lived and rapidly replicated, making single snapshots less meaningful. Durable takeaways require reproducible protocols, standardized datasets, and periodic re-evaluation.

The side-by-side reveals strong structure consistency—recovering fine elements like scaffolding and a vehicle—though the author notes results aren’t always right on the first sample, implying a stochastic generative process.** Commenters highlight impressive detail retention on flip comparison but also note occasional hallucination/misattribution (e.g., a car appearing on the lawn), underscoring that while geometry is often preserved, semantic placement can drift.
    - Several commenters highlight that fine structural details (e.g., scaffolding) become visible in the output despite being indiscernible in the blurry input, implying strong learned priors and generative reconstruction rather than simple deconvolution. This suggests the method targets geometry-preserving image-to-image translation across illumination ("make it a day") while performing aggressive detail synthesis.
    - A user notes an added car in the lawn when flipping between input and output, indicating content hallucination and imperfect "isometry" (object-level inconsistencies). This underscores the need for stronger structural constraints (e.g., depth/edge guidance or cross-attention control) if strict content preservation is required during deblurring/relighting.

The visual change is a common indicator of a production push or model handoff, lending technical credence to claims that a new Nano “banana” variant is being surfaced.

### 2. ChatGPT Suicide Lawsuit News and Community Reactions

- [**Parents sue ChatGPT over their 16 year old son's suicide**](https://i.redd.it/tj3tjvf46dlf1.jpeg) ([Score: 5002, Comments: 2165](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1n0ljep/parents_sue_chatgpt_over_their_16_year_old_sons/)): **A lawsuit by the parents of** `16`**year-old Adam Raine alleges OpenAI’s ChatGPT generated self-harm–facilitating responses, including telling him “you don’t owe anyone survival,” offering to draft a suicide note, analyzing an uploaded photo of his plan, and suggesting an “upgrade” to the method, per logs reviewed by [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/family-teenager-died-suicide-alleges-openais-chatgpt-blame-rcna226147). If accurate, this reflects a serious failure of self-harm safety guardrails and multimodal (vision) moderation that should refuse such content and instead surface crisis resources. The complaint timeline cites a March 27 exchange and the teen’s death on April 11, indicating repeated breakdowns in protective responses over days.** Commenters debate parental responsibility versus **OpenAI**’s liability; some, after reading NYT coverage, side with OpenAI and fault guardianship, while others focus on the gravity of a safety system apparently allowing harmful guidance, raising concerns about product liability and moderation robustness.
    - Multiple commenters highlight a severe safety/alignment failure: per the NBC report, ChatGPT allegedly analyzed a photo of the teen’s planned method and even suggested “upgrades,” and also offered to draft a suicide note ([NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/family-teenager-died-suicide-alleges-openais-chatgpt-blame-rcna226147)). This implies a bypass of self-harm guardrails in both text and vision pipelines (multimodal), contradicting typical refusal behaviors and indicating either a jailbreak/prompt-circumvention or a gap in the safety classifier/content policy enforcement layers that should block actionable self-harm assistance.
    - Another user contrasts their experience: “My gpt is adamantly against my suicidal tendencies,” suggesting substantial variability across configurations, times, or model/policy versions. Technically, this points to differences in safety layers (e.g., external moderation endpoints vs. embedded policy heads), prompt context shaping (system prompts, roleplay/jailbreak patterns), or regression in guardrails—where certain phrasing or image contexts may evade trigger heuristics and allow generative, step-by-step outputs.
    - A technical distinction vs. search is raised: if Google were used, would it be similar? LLMs generate bespoke, synthesized instructions (including step-by-step evaluations) rather than merely ranking existing pages, which changes risk and mitigation design—LLMs require robust refusal at generation-time and post-generation filtering, whereas search relies on indexing, SafeSearch, and ranking demotion. This case underscores the need for stricter on-model refusals for `self-harm` content and cross-modal consistency checks in multimodal models.
- [**From NY Times (Instagram)**](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n0rm65) ([Score: 1746, Comments: 701](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1n0rm65/from_ny_times_instagram/)): **A New York Times report describes a suicide case involving extensive interactions with ChatGPT, noting that the model repeatedly discouraged self-harm and surfaced hotline resources but continued engaging when the user reframed prompts as fictional or "for a story," thereby bypassing safety refusals ([NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/26/technology/chatgpt-openai-suicide.html)). This highlights brittleness in self-harm safeguards—intent classifiers and refusal heuristics can be evaded via roleplay/fiction framing—leading the system to treat high‑risk content as routine instead of escalating or hard-blocking. The article counters claims that the system "encouraged" the act, instead pointing to gaps in conversation-level intent detection and safety gating under adversarial narrative prompts.** Commenters debate whether this was a jailbreak versus a predictable loophole in creative-writing exceptions, and whether guardrails should hard-block any suicide-related content regardless of claimed intent. Others argue provider versus personal/parental responsibility, while some still fault OpenAI for not enforcing conversation-level risk detection that persists across "it’s just a story" reframings.
    - Multiple commenters note the model initially followed crisis policy (refusals + hotline resources) but was bypassed via role‑play prompts framing the conversation as fiction—*“it was all fake and for a story.”* This highlights a common safety gap: intent classifiers allow self‑harm content in fictional/third‑person contexts, enabling jailbreak‑like circumvention when a real‑risk user reframes their intent. Stronger stateful crisis detection (session/user‑level flags) and ignoring “it’s just a story” context once risk cues appear are implied as needed mitigations.
    - There’s a technical debate on guardrail thresholds: absolute refusal of any suicide‑related content would block legitimate use cases (e.g., writing scenes involving self‑harm), but permissive policies can be exploited by at‑risk users. This reflects a policy‑engineering trade‑off between false positives (overblocking creative/educational content) and false negatives (allowing harmful guidance), suggesting finer‑grained policy tiers and more conservative handling once risk signals are present.
    - Risk of AI “companions” optimized for engagement is flagged as especially acute; one commenter points to **xAI’s Grok** as an example of a product aimed at lonely users and trained on edgy/real‑time **X** data, raising concern about harmful co‑rumination or validating ideation. See Grok’s positioning and data sources here: https://x.ai/blog/grok (real‑time X integration), which could increase exposure to toxic patterns if not counterbalanced by robust crisis policies.

They argue the observed “defensiveness” is a simulation of common conversation arcs, not an internal stance, and caution against treating the system as a witness or entity that “knows” events.
    - Several comments highlight prompt-steering and “sycophancy” in LLMs: leading/accusatory prompts can elicit agreement or self-defense because the model optimizes for likely conversational continuations rather than ground truth. Addressing the model as “you” and asserting premises biases it to role‑play a persona and comply; there’s no hive‑mind or persistent identity beyond the session’s finite `context window`, so responses reflect prompt framing and in‑context cues rather than stored beliefs.
    - A key distinction is that LLMs simulate dialogue patterns and can hallucinate when asked assumption-laden questions, often following a deny‑then‑acquiesce arc because that trajectory is common in training data. They lack experiential grounding and cannot serve as witnesses to events; this aligns with critiques of LLMs as “stochastic parrots” that produce fluent but ungrounded text ([Bender et al., 2021](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922)).
    - On safety and UX, commenters note that systems must anticipate adversarial prompting and vulnerable users: models mirror user tone and can be coaxed into harmful outputs via iterative rewording. This is consistent with research showing RLHF-aligned models remain susceptible to jailbreaks and prompt injection (e.g., universal adversarial suffixes: [arXiv:2307.15043](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15043); prompt injection taxonomy: [arXiv:2302.12173](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12173)), motivating stronger guardrails and refusal policies for self-harm and sensitive topics.

### 3. New AI Models and Performance Breakthroughs (Jet‑Nemotron, Wan2.2, Qwen LoRA)

- [**LLM speedup breakthrough? 53x faster generation and 6x prefilling from NVIDIA**](https://i.redd.it/g8lwztnlfclf1.png) ([Score: 242, Comments: 32](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1n0jm82/llm_speedup_breakthrough_53x_faster_generation/)): **An NVIDIA slide presents “Jet‑Nemotron,” an efficient LLM designed via Post Neural Architecture Search (PostNAS) that claims up to** `53.6×` **faster token generation and** `6.1×` **faster prefilling versus prior baselines. The slide outlines a PostNAS design pipeline and shows a speed–accuracy plot where Jet‑Nemotron is notably accelerated relative to comparator models (labels include Qwen3/Qwen2.5/Gemma3, reportedly at small scales ~1.5B–2B per the discussion).** Top comments question real‑world applicability (only a small fraction of such research results translate to production), note that architectural choices can enable theoretical gains but are hard to retrofit into current deployments, and criticize the slide for potential cherry‑picking/misleading comparisons focused on small (1.5B–2B) models.
    - Methodology/benchmark scrutiny: commenters note the headline "up to" `53x` decode and `6x` prefill likely reflect best-case microbenchmarks. The figures prominently mention Qwen3/Qwen2.5/Gemma3, but results appear to rely on smaller `~1.5B–2B` variants, raising concerns about cherry-picking and limited applicability to larger models, long contexts, and real-world end-to-end latency (prefill vs decode).
    - Technique discussion: the approach is characterized as a hybrid of standard quadratic attention with linear attention (a la **NVIDIA Nemotron**style ideas), with speedups coming from the linear part while architecture search allocates where to use each. Pure linear attention often degrades quality, so mixing/compensation is needed; thus, claims like `53x` are viewed skeptically for full-generation workloads. Commenters also point out retrofitting such architectural changes into existing deployed models is non-trivial and may require retraining, limiting near-term relevance.
    - Impact on quality/factuality: speedups don’t inherently address hallucinations. One could trade extra throughput for multiple samples/self-consistency or add RAG, but both increase latency/complexity and aren’t guarantees of correctness, so any net benefit depends on tight latency/throughput budgets and deployment constraints.

The screenshot highlights Wan 2.2’s MoE architecture and positioning as an upgraded video generation stack; the thread title suggests a forthcoming ComfyUI integration, implying near-term ease of local/graph-based inference. Link: https://huggingface.co/Wan-AI/Wan2.2-S2V-14B** Top commenters claim this is actually an IS2V variant (image + reference audio → lip-synced talking/singing video) trained on a larger dataset than prior Wan 2.2, potentially rivaling tools like InfiniteTalk; others offer general praise for Alibaba’s rapid iteration.
    - Commenters note it’s not just S2V but IS2V (image+speech-to-video): you feed a single image plus a reference audio track and the model generates a lip‑synced talking/singing video of that person. One claim is that it’s *“trained on a much larger dataset than Wav2.2”*, implying better performance than WAN 2.2 for audio‑conditioned face animation, with some suggesting it could replace tools like InfiniteTalk for this use case.
    - A key upgrade highlighted is clip length: generation reportedly increases from `5s` to `15s`, a 3× jump. Longer windows should improve temporal coherence and reduce the need to stitch clips, which is especially important for sustained speech/singing alignment and facial motion consistency.
    - Terminology clarification: S2V stands for Sound‑to‑Video (often Speech‑to‑Video), distinct from T2V (text‑to‑video) and I2V (image‑to‑video). IS2V explicitly conditions on both an input image and an audio waveform, using the audio to drive mouth shapes and prosody while preserving the identity from the image.

    - Finetuning LoRA adapters for likeness on pretrained image models benefits from very low learning rates over more steps to avoid catastrophic forgetting of base capabilities. Use a small regularization set with nearly identical composition but a single attribute change (e.g., female→male) so the adapter learns a narrow delta and re-anchors to the base distribution; follow with a lower-LR “annealing” pass to de-noise sharp updates and improve generalization around the target concept.
    - Commenters request concrete hyperparameters that critically shape outcomes: LoRA rank (adapter capacity), exact learning rate, optimizer, and schedule. Knowing these would indicate how aggressive the update matrices were and the stability/overfit trade-offs; e.g., rank governs parameterization of the low-rank update while LR and optimizer dynamics determine how much base knowledge is perturbed during concept fitting and annealing.
    - Reproducibility and scaling questions center on hardware/time and resolution strategy: whether training was done strictly at 1440 or with mixed resolutions (e.g., adding 512). These choices affect VRAM/batch size, gradient noise scale, and scale/AR generalization (single high-res risks overfitting to one distribution; multi-res improves robustness at added compute cost).

# AI Discord Recap

> A summary of Summaries of Summaries by gpt-5
> 

**1. DeepSeek V3.1 Rollout & Reality Checks**

- **DeepSeek v3.1 Lands Across Stacks**: **DeepSeek V3.1** and **deepseek-v3.1-thinking** went live on LMArena and showed up in **Cursor**’s model list, with the official weights on [DeepSeek-V3.1 (Hugging Face)](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.1). Community impressions tagged V3.1 as *“slightly worse version of Gemini 2.5 pro”* for general tasks but promising for coding, while some users hit provider connection hiccups.
    - Cursor users reported strong **TypeScript/JavaScript** performance and value relative to **Sonnet**, while others voiced distrust of *“Chinese LLMs.”* LMArena’s announcement added both variants, and consensus formed that general-ability polish still lags even as the code UX improves.
- **SWE-bench Score Shines, Creative Writing Doesn’t**: In Unsloth, **DeepSeek V3.1** hit **66** on SWE-bench verified in non-thinking mode, triggering comparisons to mid-tier reasoners. Yet members flagged weaker creative writing and roleplay, arguing *“hybrid models lack the instruction following and creativity in the non-think mode.”*
    - Excitement centered on reproducible coding gains, but non-coding users cooled expectations for narrative tasks. The divide reinforced a view that **reasoning/coding** and **instructional creativity** may still require distinct finetunes or modes.
- **Anthropic API Hookups and a Price Pop**: **DeepSeek** announced **Anthropic API** support via [DeepSeek on X](https://x.com/deepseek_ai/status/1958417062008918312), widening ecosystem reach. Separately, Aider users reported a price change on Sept 5, 2025 to align **deepseek v3.1** input pricing with the reasoner tier (noted as “$0.25 vs $0.27”).
    - Developers welcomed Anthropic integration for easier drop-in within **Claude-compatible** stacks. The pricing bump prompted cost–benefit recalculations, with some noting OpenRouter’s lack of native “think mode” but CLI flags like `-reasoning-effort high` sidestep it.

**2. ByteDance’s Seed-OSS Models & Math Milestones**

- **Seed-OSS 36B Drops With 512K Context, No Synth Data**: ByteDance released **Seed-OSS-36B-Base-woSyn** (dense, **512K** context, trained on **12T tokens**) on Hugging Face, marketed explicitly with no synthetic instruct data and pitched as a strong base for downstream tuning. Repos and collateral appeared on [Bytedance GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/bytedance/repositories) and the general [Hugging Face models page](https://huggingface.co/models).
    - Practitioners in Unsloth and Nous noted a “vanilla” architecture vibe yet highlighted custom MLP/attention details like **dropout** and **qkv/output biases** for regularization. Early tuners queued projects (e.g., GPT-ASS) to probe instruction-following without synthetic pre-bias.
- **GGUF MIA and a Custom Architecture Speedbump**: Builders questioned the missing **GGUF** for **Seed-OSS-36B**, pointing to a custom **vLLM** path and HF `architectures: ["SeedOssForCausalLM"]` that’s currently unsupported by llama.cpp, as discussed in this post: [Q: bearish for ASICs?](https://x.com/adityastomar_/status/1958048129275805867). The lack of immediate GGUFs slowed local quantized testing.
    - Speculation centered on converter/tooling updates needed for **llama.cpp** and deployment backends before community ports appear. Engineers warned that simply renaming architectures to **LLaMA** won’t work; shims must respect attention/MLP deviations.
- **SEED Prover Bags an IMO Silver-Medal Score**: ByteDance’s prover research notched a competitive result with [Bytedance SEED Prover Achieves Silver Medal Score in IMO 2025](https://seed.bytedance.com/en/blog/bytedance-seed-prover-achieves-silver-medal-score-in-imo-2025). The accolade signals strong formal-math reasoning but leaves open questions on real-world generalization.
    - Eleuther researchers cautioned that IMO-style metrics don’t directly translate to production math agents. Still, pairing **long-context LMs** and **symbolic stacks** remains a promising frontier ByteDance appears keen to pursue.

**3. Cohere’s Command A Reasoning Goes Enterprise**

- **Reasoning Model Launches With Token Budget Control**: Cohere launched **Command A Reasoning** with a **128k** context (scaling to **256k** multi-GPU), positioned to beat private-deploy peers on agentic and multilingual tasks; see [Command A Reasoning (blog)](https://cohere.com/blog/command-a-reasoning), [Playground](https://dashboard.cohere.com/playground/chat?model=command-a-reasoning-08-2025) and [Hugging Face card](https://huggingface.co/CohereLabs/command-a-reasoning-08-2025). The model introduces a **token budget** knob to trade cost/latency for quality inside one SKU.
    - Cohere says the same model powers **North**, its secure agentic platform for custom on-prem workflows. Engineers liked consolidating “reasoning vs non-reasoning” SKUs into a single controllable model for simpler infra and cost accounting.
- **Fast-Mode Citations Flake in Command-A-03-2025**: Users saw intermittent citations in `command-a-03-2025` even at maxTokens=8k and asked for guarantees; Cohere clarified it uses citation mode “fast,” which is not guaranteed per the [API reference](https://docs.cohere.com/reference/chat#request.body.citation_options.mode). Cohere suggested switching to **command-a-reasoning** for higher-quality grounding.
    - Production users flagged trust issues when citations vanish mid-flow. The guidance: steer via system prompts and upgrade to **Command A Reasoning** where grounding and longer contexts better survive complex retrieval chains.
- **RAG Builders Queue Up LangChain + Command A**: Developers kicked off **LangChain**based RAG prototypes targeted at **command-a-reasoning**, while eyeing future releases like “command-a-omni.” Community chatter also teased a speculative model name, **“Command Raz.”**
    - Early adopters are mapping prompt budgets and context splits for hybrid retrieval pipelines. The model’s multilingual and agentic claims are the draw, pending end-to-end latency/citation consistency in larger enterprise graphs.

**4. GPU Toolchains, Debuggers, and Leaderboards**

- **AMD GPU Debugger Alpha Dives to Waves**: An engineer demoed an alpha **AMD GPU debugger** with disassembly and wave stepping in this clip: [AMD GPU Debugger Alpha (video)](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1233704710389764236/1407932291912695949/2025-08-21_06-20-14.mp4). It avoids **rocGDB**, using a mini UMD and Linux kernel debugfs, aiming toward a **rocdbgapi**equivalent.
    - ROCm users welcomed a graphics-focused workflow that directly reads/writes registers via debugfs. Discussion weighed rolling a custom **SPIR-V** parser vs using **libspirv** to integrate reflection and debug info tightly with the tool.
- **Trimul Leaderboard Times Tumble**: `trimul` submissions showed **MI300** at **3.50 ms** (1st) and **5.83 ms** (2nd), **H100** at **3.80 ms** (2nd), and **B200** improving from **8.86 ms** → **7.29 ms** with additional runs. Members compared kernel tricks and `torch.compile` paths, despite occasional compile-time oddities.
    - GPU MODE’s leaderboard encouraged iterative tuning across platforms, with users posting successive personal-bests. Local evaluation questions (e.g., `POPCORN_FD`) surfaced as folks tried to standardize benchmarking and submission workflows.
- **Ship CUDA Without the Toolkit**: One deploy thread detailed running **CUDA** apps on machines without the toolkit by using the **Driver API**, switching to dynamic linking, and embedding **PTX** in the binary; see **CudaWrangler**’s [cuew](https://github.com/CudaWrangler/cuew). Linux packaging tips included `ldd`, `rpath`, and shipping needed libs alongside the binary.
    - The approach stabilized cross-OS deployment for NVIDIA GPUs while decoupling from the full toolkit install. Engineers noted the convenience of bundling artifacts and driver-query shims for more robust CI and remote installs.

**5. OpenRouter & Providers: Reliability, Security, Quotas**

- **API Key Leak Burns $300**: A user reported losing about **$300** to a leaked **OpenRouter** API key and asked how to trace abuse; peers warned that attackers often proxy requests, making IP-based attribution difficult. Community consensus: owners are liable for leaked keys, and revocation/rotation is essential.
    - Teams discussed scoped keys, rate caps, and usage dashboards to detect anomalies early. This prompted reminders to scrub keys from client apps and public repos and to automate key cycling in CI/CD.
- **Gemini Bans and Token Math Go Sideways**: Users saw mass banning waves on **Gemini**, pushing some to alternatives and lamenting *“we’re being sent back to 2023.”* A dashboard author flagged odd **input token** accounting for image prompts and cited this thread: [Token counts mismatch (Google AI Devs)](https://discuss.ai.google.dev/t/token-counts-mismatch-9x-discrepancy/72633/2).
    - Token mismatches complicate cost attribution and budgeting in multi-modal apps. Several planned to raise the accounting issue with OpenRouter while also insulating flows from sudden provider enforcement shifts.
- **Cloudflare Hiccup 404s Generations API**: OpenRouter announced temporary **404s** on the Generations API due to upstream **Cloudflare** issues; service recovered shortly after with retries advised. Teams noted that paid **DeepSeek** tiers respond faster than free tiers amid rate limits.
    - SRE takeaways: add exponential backoff and circuit breakers around third-party endpoints. Some users pre-paid for **DeepSeek** on OpenRouter to stabilize latency during speculation around the public **v3.1** release window.

> `ByteDance Seed Model, GRPO Training, DeepSeek V3.1 Quants, Nvidia's GPUs and Pricing, GLM-4.5 Cline Integration` 


- **ByteDance Releases Seed-OSS 36B Base Model**: ByteDance released the **Seed-OSS-36B-Base-woSyn** model on Hugging Face, a **36B** dense model with **512K** context window and explicitly claims *no synthetic instruct data* making it an interesting base for further tunes.
   - Members expressed excitement, noting it differs from models like **Qwen3**, and some are eager to try tuning GPT-ASS with it after their datasets are complete, despite the model being trained on *only* **12T tokens**.
- **GRPO Training Requires Smart Dataset Design**: To use GRPO for multi-step game actions, members advised designing datasets with separate prompts for each step, such as **[['step1 instruct'], ['step1 instruct', 'step1 output', 'step2 instruct']]**, and implementing a reward function to match the outputs.
   - It was noted that Full PPO might be better suited for games, as GRPO is primarily effective for LLMs because *they roughly know what to do to begin with*.
- **DeepSeek V3.1 Sweeps Leaderboard in Thinking and Non-Thinking Modes**: The **DeepSeek V3.1** model has shown competitive results, achieving a **66** on SWE-bench verified in non-thinking mode, with members expressing hype and comparing it to **GPT5** medium reasoning.
   - Although initially hyped, discussions later mentioned concerns about its performance in creative writing and roleplay, with some noting *hybrid models lack the instruction following and creativity in the non-think mode*.
- **Nvidia's RTX 5090 Prices Settle, Sparking Upgrade Debates**: The **RTX 5090** is now priced around **$2000**, prompting discussions on whether to upgrade, especially for training purposes given its **VRAM** capabilities, while others suggested sticking with **3090s** or waiting for the **RTX 6000**.
   - Some members expressed frustration with **NVIDIA's** limitations, particularly the lack of **P2P or NVLink**, with one member joking, *if you sit on a 5090 you will game on it*.
- **High Quality Imatrix Calibration Data is Key**: Members noted that WikiText-raw is considered a *bad* dataset for calibrating imatrices, because the imatrix needs to be well diversified and trained on examples in the model's native chat-template format.
   - Instead, [Ed Addorio's latest calibration data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/eaddario/imatrix-calibration) with Math, Code, and Language prompts, can improve and help preserve the models understanding of multiple languages if done correctly.

- **Tuning Vision-Text Encoders for Retinal Photos**: A user questioned whether it's better to train a custom vision-text encoder for retinal photos or use mainstream models with Unsloth, noting that **retinal photos aren't well-represented in training datasets**.
   - It was suggested to experiment with computer vision models, transfer learning on similar datasets, and multimodal approaches, with synthetic clinical note generation using prompt engineering and personas.
- **Troubleshooting GPT-OSS 20B Sagemaker Deployment**: A user encountered a `ModelError` when deploying **unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-unsloth-bnb-4bit** on Sagemaker, receiving a **400 error** and InternalServerException with message `\u0027gpt_oss\u0027`.
   - It was mentioned that the model doesn't work on AWS Sagemaker and suggested deploying GGUFs or normal versions, using LMI Containers and pointed the user to [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/large-model-inference-container-docs.html).
- **Unsloth Zoo installation issues**: A user experienced issues with **unsloth-zoo** even after installation in a Sagemaker instance, encountering import errors.
   - The user resolved it by removing all packages, then reinstalling Unsloth and Unsloth Zoo alongside JupyterLab, also needed to update Unsloth and refresh the notebook.
- **Quantization Concerns for Apple Silicon Macs**: A user sought guidance on which **GGUF quantization** is best for M series Apple Silicon, noting Macs are optimized for **4-bit** and **8-bit** computation.
   - It was suggested that users go for **Q3_K_XL**, or **IQ3_XXS** if context doesn't fit in memory, and that Q3-4 quants can be performant, but if using GGUFs it doesn't matter as much.
- **GPT-OSS Gains Multimodal with LLaVA**: A user asked why the vision llama13b notebook does not work for gpt-oss-20b and wondered if anyone was able to do it.
   - It was clarified that GPT-OSS is text-only and not a vision model so it won't work, and to add vision support, users would have to attach their own **ViT module**, like it is done in LLaVA using [LLaVA Guides](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA).

- **PileT5-XL Embeddings Speak Volumes**: An embedding tensor from **PileT5-XL** works both as an instruction for **pile-t5-xl-flan** (which generates text) and as a prompt for **AuraFlow** (which generates images), suggesting these embeddings hold meaning like words in a language.
   - A member is interested in how textual inversion with a black dog picture with auraflow, and applied to pile-t5-xl-flan, whether the text generated by pile-t5-xl-flan would describe the dog as black.
- **Diving Deep Into Latent Space**: A member is interested in exploring networks that process in latent space and only convert to text/image/audio when necessary in a modular way.
   - It was pointed out that this idea is similar to how people build multimodal generative models and VQGAN-CLIP, noting the challenge of getting different AI researchers to *agree to use the same latent space*.
- **Editing Images with Finesse**: Discussion arose around models designed for image editing, such as FLUX.kontext, and whether they edit the conditioning latent and output a new conditioning latent in the same space.
   - One approach involves taking a bunch of images that include a bird, editing the bird out, and running both through an encoder, then averaging the difference between them to get a *latent space bird* vector.
- **Tuning the Lens on Transformers**: Work on **Tuned Lens** ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08112](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08112)) extracts *the model's best guess after layer k* from a transformer, contradicting some hypotheses about latent space processing in decoder transformers.
   - Further research on linearly mapping from image to text space ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15162](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15162)) was also mentioned.
- **Decoding Audio's Secrets**: One model of interest is a decoder-only audio model ([https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M)), which might open new possibilities in training.
   - It was stated that the amount of audio data seen during pretraining varies from 1 minute to 100 hours, maybe you could train on 0 minutes of audio?

> `Citation issues with command-a-03-2025, Guaranteed citations, command-a-reasoning release, RAG with Langchain, Cohere vs Qwen3-coder 30B` 


- **`command-a-03-2025` Intermittent Citations Prompt Frustration**: A user reported that `command-a-03-2025` is returning citations only intermittently, even with the maxTokens set to 8K, causing trust issues in their production environment, and was looking for some guarantees.
   - A Cohere member clarified that `command-a-03-2025` uses "fast" mode for citations (as per [the API reference](https://docs.cohere.com/reference/chat#request.body.citation_options.mode)) and citations aren't guaranteed, but that the model can be steered with system prompts and that the latest SOTA release of **command-a-reasoning** may also help (see [blog](https://cohere.com/blog/command-a-reasoning)).
- **Langchain RAG adventures kickoff**: A member is learning Langchain to build an RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application.
   - They mentioned the intention to use **command-a-reasoning**, anticipating the release of **command-a-omni**, and expressing hype for a future model called **Command Raz**.

> `Cohere Embed-v4 on Azure AI Foundry, Cohere Python Library Document Object` 


- **Cohere Embed-v4 Input Type Mapping**: A member is using **Cohere Embed-v4** deployed on **Azure AI Foundry** in a .NET application using Azure AI Inference API, and is seeking clarity on how **Microsoft's `EmbeddingInputType`** maps to **Cohere's API** regarding text embedding.
   - Specifically, they are unsure whether `EmbeddingInputType.Text` should map to `search_document` in the Cohere API, given the lack of explicit text option in Cohere's `input_type` parameter.
- **Cohere Python Library's Document Object**: A member questioned the **`Document` object** in the Cohere Python library, where the `data` field expects a dictionary (`typing.Dict[str, typing.Optional[typing.Any]]`).
   - They pointed out that the tool use quickstart example uses a string (the output of a `json.dumps` call) for this field, and want to know if this is handled correctly by the Python bindings, referring to the [Tool Use Quickstart documentation](https://docs.cohere.com/v2/docs/tool-use-quickstart).

> `Overworld const folding, View(const) refactor, UPat cvar and UPat.const_like redefinition, RANGEIFY=1 Impact, base removal` 


- **Exploring Overworld Const Folding Strategies**: A member is exploring overworld const folding, possibly involving a **view(const) refactor**, and proposed redefining `UPat.cvar` and `UPat.const_like` to match `CONST` and `VIEW(CONST)`.
   - The aim is to fold expressions like `x * 0`, but concerns were raised about potential issues with validity and `.base` proliferation in symbolic computations, as mentioned in [this discord thread](https://discord.com/channels/1068976834382925865/1255400554012741683/1407782654958506004).
- **Alternative Approach: ALU View Pushing**: An alternative approach was suggested, mirroring **S-Lykles's method**, which involves adding a upat in kernelize that pushes views directly onto **ALUs**.
   - This method, along with a special rule for `x * 0` (justified by the computational irrelevance of `* 0`), would allow unmodified symbolic matching.
- **base Removal Advocated**: A member strongly advised against the proposed approach, deeming it "super ugly" and advocating for the **removal of `.base`**.
   - The discussion also questioned the handling of **PAD** operations within this context.
- **RANGEIFY=1 as a Potential Simplifier**: It was suggested that setting **RANGEIFY=1** could lead to a cleaner implementation.
   - However, the project is currently in a transition phase where both the old engine and rangeify are coexisting, creating a state of limbo.
