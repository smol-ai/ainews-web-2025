Taking a little leapfrog from [the GPT5 roadmap](https://www.theverge.com/news/611365/openai-gpt-4-5-roadmap-sam-altman-orion), [Claude 3.7 Sonnet launched](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet) today ([don't ask about the name](https://x.com/mikeyk/status/1894112962572358032?s=46) - note that there are [TWO blogposts](https://www.anthropic.com/news/visible-extended-thinking) and [documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking) and [cookbooks](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/tree/main/extended_thinking) and [prompting guides](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips) to read, alongside [Claude Code which is in limited preview](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview)), after numerous leaks from private previews, as one model with an optional thinking mode, with an explicit token budget.
