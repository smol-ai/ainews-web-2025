A banner day for Chinese open weights AI. The generative media types should definitely take a look at [Wan 2.2](https://wan.video/welcome), but most AI Engineers should be apprised of Z.ai's (better known as [Zhipu, one of the AI Tigers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhipu_AI)) GLM-4.5-355B-A32B and GLM-4.5-Air-106B-A12B released today. They make a VERY strong claim (to be independently verified) of being not only the strongest open weights model (beating the previous SOTA [Kimi K-2](https://news.smol.ai/issues/25-07-11-kimi-k2)) but also highly competitive with and often better than heavyweight SOTA models like Claude 4 Opus, Grok 4, and OpenAI's o3:

No technical specifics or benchmarks defining the improvements between versions are provided.** Top commenters note the lack of concrete technical definitions for advancing from GPT-5 to GPT-8, questioning what constitutes a meaningful progression and highlighting the absence of agreed-upon metrics. There is also skepticism and mild satire regarding model naming convention bloat and perceived variation in model intelligence over time.
    - There is technical skepticism about the meaningfulness of statements regarding OpenAI's pathway to 'GPT-8', citing the absence of defined metrics or objective benchmarks to distinguish advancements between versions such as GPT-5, GPT-6, or beyond. Commenters argue that without published evaluation standards or transparent progress criteria, claims about future model numbers lack tangible technical substance.
    - Another user references how access to the original article is constrained by paywalls, but points to an [archived copy](https://archive.is/TYCP0), clarifying that the information about OpenAI's internal roadmap comes from a leaked or purported screenshot, not public technical documentation, making it difficult to independently verify the engineering details behind the versioning claims.
- [**OpenAI CEO Sam Altman: "It feels very fast." - "While testing GPT5 I got scared" - "Looking at it thinking: What have we done... like in the Manhattan Project"- "There are NO ADULTS IN THE ROOM"**](https://v.redd.it/p7jy6p0znkff1) ([Score: 386, Comments: 301](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1mbafk7/openai_ceo_sam_altman_it_feels_very_fast_while/)): **OpenAI CEO Sam Altman reportedly made comments in reference to testing GPT-5, comparing his emotional response to the Manhattan Project and stating there were "no adults in the room," hinting at both the *pace* of AI development and a perceived lack of governance or oversight. Although no technical benchmarks or model specifications were disclosed in the post, the implication is that GPT-5's performance or capabilities are sufficiently advanced to provoke caution even among its developers.** The top comments express strong skepticism towards Altman's pattern of making dramatic claims before major releases (citing previous over-hyped launches), with users asserting that new GPT versions deliver only incremental improvements rather than the radical breakthroughs hinted at in Altman's statements.
    - Several users point out that **Sam Altman’s repeated hype cycles**—including claims that GPT-5 made him feel frightened or invoked Manhattan Project analogies—tend to be met with skepticism, with the technical leap between model versions (like improved math capability) often seen as overblown compared to real existential concerns.
    - A theme emerges around **overstating AI capability and risk**: commenters argue that while new models such as GPT-5 may show incremental improvements, the portrayal of these upgrades as world-shaking or unmanageable can be misleading, especially for technically literate audiences.
    - There is a critique of **AI leadership responsibility**, with some users noting that OpenAI is in fact "the adult in the room" and responsible for guiding development and communication, rather than dramatizing AI as an unstoppable force beyond their control.

### 3. Claude Code, Agents, and Plugin Ecosystem: Community Tools and Rate Limit Policies

- [**found claude code plugins that actually work**](https://i.redd.it/06yaijkfniff1.png) ([Score: 359, Comments: 71](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1mb37uj/found_claude_code_plugins_that_actually_work/)): **The image appears to show a screenshot or diagram related to the "CCPlugins" GitHub project, which introduces a set of slash-command plugins designed to improve workflow with Claude (Anthropic's LLM). The key technical concept is that the commands are phrased conversationally rather than imperatively, which the author claims enhances Claude's responsiveness and versatility (e.g., 'I'll help you clean your project' rather than 'CLEAN PROJECT NOW'). Commands automate tasks like project cleanup, session management, comment removal, code review (without extensive architecture critique), running tests and fixing simple issues, type cleanup (replacing 'any' in TypeScript), context caching, and undo functionality. The implementation reportedly works universally across projects without special setup and features 'elegant documentation.'** A key debate in the comments centers on the post's authorship transparency and the need for an installer given the plugins are simply markdown files, suggesting some skepticism about the packaging and presentation. Another user shares related Claude hooks and configuration, indicating community interest in extensibility and customization.
    - A user identified a technical issue with the installation process on Ubuntu: running the provided curl and bash command results in the error `cp: cannot stat './commands/*.md': No such file or directory`, indicating that the install script expects files in a location or format that may not exist in fresh environments. The commenter suggests the documentation or script should be updated for reliability.
    - Another user questions the need for an installer when the plugins are reportedly just markdown files to be placed in `.claude/commands`, raising concerns about overengineering or unnecessary packaging complexity for simple file deployment.
    - A participant shared an external resource—a GitHub repository ([https://github.com/fcakyon/claude-settings)—containing](https://github.com/fcakyon/claude-settings)%E2%80%94containing) additional hooks, commands, and MCPs for Claude, offering alternative implementation patterns and plug-and-play code examples to extend Claude's capabilities.
- [**Claude Custom Sub Agents are amazing feature and I built 20 of them to open source.**](https://v.redd.it/5d5w2jokakff1) ([Score: 128, Comments: 70](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1mb95kp/claude_custom_sub_agents_are_amazing_feature_and/)): **The project [awesome-claude-agents](https://github.com/vijaythecoder/awesome-claude-agents) provides an open-source set of 26 specialized Claude sub-agents acting as a coordinated AI development team. Each agent represents a specific software dev role (backend, frontend, API, ORM, etc.), with orchestration enabling parallel execution and specialization—mimicking a real agile team structure to improve code quality, system architecture, and delivery via command-line invocation. The solution addresses the lack of cross-agent orchestration in base Claude sub-agent workflows by introducing a 'Tech Lead' coordinator and explicit task breakdown, configurable via a** `team-configurator` **CLI command.** Top technical concerns raised by commenters include increased token consumption and the risk of multiplying bugs with parallel agent execution, while skepticism also exists regarding the authenticity of the project's origins (suggesting the project or post may itself be AI-generated).
    - A user points out that running 26 parallel sub-agents potentially introduces significant complexity and could lead to an exponential growth in possible bugs, highlighting a classic trade-off in large agent-based systems between capability and maintenance overhead.
    - Another commenter asks whether the use of subagents affects performance, specifically if it leads to slower execution, raising concerns about the scalability and efficiency of coordinating multiple agents within such architectures.
    - There is also a mention of increased token usage as a direct consequence of leveraging multiple agents, suggesting that this approach might significantly increase operational costs when using API-driven LLM services.
- [**Updating rate limits for Claude subscription customers**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1mbo1sb/updating_rate_limits_for_claude_subscription/) ([Score: 384, Comments: 599](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1mbo1sb/updating_rate_limits_for_claude_subscription/)): *Anthropic is implementing weekly rate limits for Claude Pro and Max subscribers starting late August 2024, impacting <5% of users based on resource consumption metrics (e.g., edge cases with 24/7 usage or users incurring 'tens of thousands' worth of compute on $200 plans). The rate-limiting move aims to ensure fair allocation of resources, prevent abuses like account sharing or reselling, and preserve service reliability amidst recent reliability and performance issues. Max 20x subscribers will have the option to purchase additional usage at standard API rates, and alternative pathways for 'long-running' advanced use cases are in development.*Top commenters are skeptical about the claimed '5%' impact, question why global limits are imposed instead of targeting only abusers, and allude to public leaderboard users who may be responsible for heavy 24/7 compute usage.
    - A user suggests implementing an always-visible, user-toggable interface that shows percentage consumption of rate limits per model, along with relevant time frames. This feature would help users monitor their usage and better understand when they are approaching limits, addressing transparency concerns with the updated restriction policies.
    - There is technical confusion around the new rate limiting approach, with questions on whether limits now reset weekly instead of daily. This affects usage planning and could impact how subscription users schedule their automated or high-frequency workflows under the new rules.
    - Some users express concern that the policy targets only a small percentage ('5%') of heavy users, but without sufficient transparency, regular users may suffer as a result. They highlight the need for more granular usage statistics from the provider to clarify how the limits affect different customer groups.
- [**RIP Claude Code - Just got this email**](https://i.redd.it/pp2ic681unff1.jpeg) ([Score: 190, Comments: 91](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1mbojhy/rip_claude_code_just_got_this_email/)): **The post discusses an email from Anthropic regarding significant changes to Claude Code's Max plan usage: weekly rate limits are being clarified as '140-280 hours of Sonnet 4' and '15-35 hours of Opus 4' for most users, with heavy users (especially those running large codebases or multiple instances in parallel) potentially hitting limits earlier. These changes address sustainability issues due to heavy resource consumption under the fixed-fee plan, as highlighted in the email and the discussion of users abusing unlimited code execution.** Commenters largely agree that the changes are reasonable, with some blaming heavy users for plan abuse and others pointing to public bragging about exploiting the system (e.g., running multiple Claude Code instances and amassing large token usage under one subscription).
    - Key details from the emailed changes specify that Max 5x users will receive '140-280 hours of Sonnet 4 and 15-35 hours of Opus 4 within their weekly rate limits', with heavy users potentially encountering caps sooner, especially if running 'multiple Claude Code instances in parallel'. This effectively quantifies the new usage boundaries imposed by Anthropic.
    - Several comments discuss excessive resource exploitation by users running numerous parallel Claude Code sessions, achieving disproportionate usage and incurring high backend costs ('racking thousands of dollars in tokens') while only paying a fixed subscription; this is identified as the motive for Anthropic implementing stricter rate limits.
    - A technically inclined commenter emphasizes that if these new restrictions reduce 'unplanned outages', it would improve service quality for everyone, suggesting the prior abuse potentially contributed to service instability.

> `Gemma 3 fine-tuning errors, SFT Dataset Format, Training Time for Gemma 3 12b, Qwen3 model, GGUF Conversion` 


- **Gemma 3 Fine-Tuning Frustrations Surface**: A member reported an `AttributeError` when trying to save a fine-tuned **Gemma3-12b** model from **LoRA** checkpoints as a **GGUF** file, specifically related to a missing `save_pretrained_merged` attribute.
   - Roland Tannous recommended manually converting using the *llama.cpp* conversion script, as the `save_to_gguf` logic is being reworked and not functioning as expected.
- **SFT Dataset Format Deep Dive**: A member inquired about the correct data format for **SFT**, asking if data in *prompt, completion* format should be mapped to an array of `{ "prompt" : prompt_content}, {"completion" : completion_content}`.
   - One member clarified that for **SFT** with *prompt completion*, one should use two JSON objects containing input and output (prompt and completion), removing the `text` key, which would otherwise run raw completion on the data as a string.
- **Medical Model Mishaps**: A member reported an issue regarding training a model and exporting it to **Ollama**, and reported issues following the steps in the [Unsloth notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/unslothai/notebooks/blob/main/nb/Llama3_%288B%29-Ollama.ipynb?authuser=1#scrollTo=j6cipBJBudxv).
   - Roland Tannous reiterated that saving to **GGUF** needs to be done manually, because automatic logic is temporarily unavailable.
- **Tokenizer Troubles with Gemma3**: A user encountered an `AttributeError: 'Gemma3Processor' object has no attribute 'encode'` error, even after upgrading, while using `tokenizer.encode(value)`.
   - It was clarified that for Gemma3 1B (a text model), the tokenizer is a simple tokenizer, while the larger models (vision and text) use a processor, sitting one layer deeper, so that `tokenizer.tokenizer.encode` is the correct implementation.
- **ZeroDivisionError Strikes Training Loop**: A member ran into a `ZeroDivisionError: division by zero` during training, traced back to the loss function and `cut_cross_entropy/cce.py`, after updating to a newer version of Unsloth.
   - It was observed that all label values were being set to -100, but no direct solution was provided.

> `emotional structuring through prompts, clarity vs ambiguity in prompts, core of prompt engineering, anti-sychophancy custom instructions, training the model` 


- **Prompt Engineering Core Principles Emerge**: The core of prompt engineering involves picking a well-understood language, knowing what you want, explaining it accurately, and verifying the output, with special attention to **fact-checking** and potential hallucinations.
   - It was stated that prompt engineering is *the art and practice of figuring out where possible, and inside allowed content, how to get the exact desired output from the model*.
- **Custom Instructions Taming Chatbot**: One member uses custom instructions for *measured and calm analysis and careful thought*, and anti-sycophancy for code projects.
   - This shapes the model's responses with a measured/academic attitude, avoiding rushing.
- **Explicit Instructions Trump Negative Directives**: Instead of *'don't do that'*, give examples of what you **DO** want and show the model what a great reply should look like to guide its output.
   - If you can't at all get it to open with the goal, try for it to say something 'less bad' and easy to tolerate.
- **Long Instructions risk Conflicts**: A key is **no conflicting instructions**, and the longer your instructions, the more space for risk of conflict between *thing you said* and *other thing you said*.
   - If you can build long instructions and can prevent or resolve conflicts, that can work but if you don't already wanna use a long-form, there's no reason to switch.
- **Large Memories Impact Chatbot**: A member said that memories can contains thousands of characters, the content matters and also *when to use what and how to resolve any conflicts*.
   - There was an issue with strange behavior that could persist **if we let the memory get over 100%**.

> `Prompt Engineering, Training the model, Custom Instructions, Model Memories, Blog Post writing with ChatGPT` 


- **Prompt Engineering Core Principles**: Prompt engineering revolves around understanding the AI's language, defining desired outputs, clear communication, and meticulous output verification including fact-checking; focusing on **what you want the model to do** is key.
   - Focusing 99-100% on *'what do I want the model to do'* can allow you to share that with the model to guide the responses.
- **Training Model to Avoid Introductory Connector Statements**: Instead of negative directives, provide **examples** of desired outputs, and if the model *has* to include an opener, aim for a very short, tolerable phrase.
   - Flip the script: give examples of what you *do* want, and if mentioning bad examples, detail *why* they're bad and how they could be improved.
- **Analogizing Model Behavior to Dog Training**: Models, like dogs, require a **clear task** to avoid unwanted actions; instead of just saying *'no'*, provide an alternative action to redirect the model's output.
   - Give the model mind another task to do, that gets in the way of the unwanted action, offer a treat or tell it to come to you, give it something else to focus on to replace the bad output.
- **The Art of Long-Form Instruction and Conflict Resolution**: While long-form instructions can be effective, avoiding **conflicting instructions** is crucial; the more instructions, the higher the risk of conflict and the more difficult it becomes to resolve.
   - If you can build long instructions and can prevent or resolve conflicts, that can work; you can ask the model what it means to it, and if there's any conflicts or ambiguities, and then discuss and learn how to say for the model exactly what you mean to express.
- **Optimizing Model Memories for Peak Performance**: The **content and clarity** of model memories matter more than their length; ensure the model understands when to use each memory and how to resolve conflicts for desired outputs.
   - There was a time when strange behaviors were seen if the memories got over 100%, but whether that still matters, there is no intention to risk it by letting memories get to that capacity.

> `Mojo GPU Training Libraries, Nabla vs JAX, Mojo MAX Interface, Mojo vs Rust, Bitnet model in Modular` 


- **Nabla is the main Mojo training library**: [Nabla](https://github.com/nabla-ml/nabla) is a training library for Mojo that is slightly faster than **JAX** on some hardware, but may require more manual code writing.
   - The Mojo interface to **MAX** is not currently maintained due to issues, impacting performance and *Mojo* itself is not ready for a full training framework due to missing features like IO and threading.
- **Mojo: CUDA or Graph Compiler?**: Mojo's GPU support functions more like **CUDA** than a graph compiler, allowing functions to run directly on the GPU.
   - Custom kernels are easily written in Mojo, with the inference framework around **MAX** using kernels written entirely in Mojo.
- **Rust vs Mojo: Which to Learn?**: Mojo is pre-1.0 language and may have breaking changes and missing features, so one of the members recommended reading **Rust's** learning materials.
   - Another member suggested that **Rust's CUDA** bindings can be a pain to work with.
- **Microsoft's Bitnet Model for Modular?**: Members discussed adding Microsoft's [bitnet-b1.58-2B-4T](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04101) model to **Modular**, citing its CPU-based nature and potential inclusiveness.

> `Python Interop Nanobind vs Cython, Mojo FFI, Mojo GPU Support, Mojo Compiler MetaProgramming` 


- **Nanobind Favored over Cython for Python Interop**: Modular prefers **Nanobind** over **Cython** for Python interop due to its pure **C++** nature and superior tooling for stub file generation as well as runtime performance demonstrated in [benchmarks](https://nanobind.readthedocs.io/en/latest/benchmark.html).
   - Mojo aims for seamless interop to avoid creating another language on top of Mojo, with eventual customization similar to **PyO3**.
- **Mojo Plans Transparent Python Extension Exports**: Mojo aims to support transparent Python extension creation with minimal annotations, automatically exporting functions convertible to Python objects, without manual decoration such as `@export[abi="python"]`.
   - The goal is to simplify Python interop by automatically detecting functions for export, with optional annotations for customization.
- **Mojo's C ABI FFI Capabilities**: Mojo has FFI for **C/C++**, enabling importing C libraries using `ffi.DLHandle(path)`.
   - While not fully advanced, it allows calling any **C ABI** function linked in the current address space, as long as justification is provided.
- **Mojo's Vision for GPU Compute**: Mojo seeks GPU integration, steering clear of CUDA-specific elements to sustain portability, leaning towards incorporating more native APIs given vendors have abandoned OpenCL.
   - While CUDA drivers remain essential, the plan involves utilizing Apple Silicon and AMD GPUs, possibly including OpenCL as a fallback, or even Intel.
- **Mojo Supports Compile-Time Execution and Metaprogramming**: Mojo can execute code without IO at compile time, enabling the creation of structures like chess engines that pre-compute game states using features similar to **Rust's traits** and dependent types.
   - Heap allocated memory can be materialized into dynamic values, which can be leveraged to precompute lookup tables, trees, graphs, and tries, as shown in the [August 2023 Changelog](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/changelog#august-2023).

> `Blue/Green Docker Servers for Factorio, Factorio Save Files vs FLE Game State, Python vs Bash for Docker Management, Multiplayer Mod Issues, Episode Boundaries and State Resets` 


- ****Blue/Green Docker Servers** Proposed for Hot-Loading Factorio**: A member proposed using **blue/green docker servers** for hot-loading/reset in Factorio, leveraging Factorio's native save/load and pre-loading a paused standby server, then flipping the rcon endpoint to the standby.
   - The member argued that this approach trades a little infra for a lot of determinism, offering **zero drift** and trivial rollbacks, though it requires maintaining two instances.
- ****Factorio Save Files** vs. FLE Game State: A Detailed Comparison**: A discussion ensued comparing **Factorio save files** (robust, deterministic, but heavier) and **FLE game state** (fast for small maps, human-readable, but brittle at scale).
   - The conversation weighed the benefits of each, with one member suggesting an evaluation of managing save games on a single server to gauge latency costs before committing to blue/green deployments.
- ****Python's Docker API** Challenges Bash for Environment Management**: Members discussed porting the `run-env.sh` script to Python for greater control over Docker image creation and scenario conversion, though it initially proved slower than bash + compose.
   - One member highlighted the power of the Python approach in simplifying environment setup, while another noted the use of `aiodocker` for improved speed.
- ****Multiplayer Mod Issues** Require Container Restarts**: Users encountered a 'Cannot join' error related to mismatched mod event handlers, indicating that certain mods were not multiplayer-safe.
   - The resolution involved restarting the docker container to ensure identical mod configurations between the client and server.
- ****Episode Boundaries** Trigger State Saving and Resets**: It was clarified that **TrajectoryRunner** finishes an episode loop and calls `Environment.reset(...)` at episode boundaries, clearing agent namespaces and resetting timers/ticks.
   - State is also saved after every sample during MCTS and can be resumed from the database, with resets occurring at every `env.step()` call to ensure checkpointed states.

- **Debugging LlamaIndex OpenTelemetry**: A user was debugging their use of **LlamaIndexOpenTelemetry**, finding traces in their OTLP platform but without attributes, and was pointed to the [workflows-py notebook](https://github.com/run-llama/workflows-py/blob/main/examples/observability/workflows_observability_pt1.ipynb) as a readable example.
   - They were also told that spans themselves won't have many attributes, and they should look at the events under that span.
- **Intent-Aware Semantic Search Strategies Emerge**: A user is exploring ways to make semantic search more intent-aware, noting that current methods using dense embeddings don't always capture the specific intent behind a query, citing the case where searching for *"What is the name of the customer?"* returns generic results.
