The deployment is part of **Huawei Cloud's ModelArts Studio** using the **Ascend-Adapted New Model**, with models like **DeepSeek-R1-Distill**, **Qwen-14B**, **Qwen-32B**, and **Llama-8B** already launched, and more models expected soon.
  - Discussion highlights skepticism about the **Huawei 910C** chips and their performance, with some suggesting they are slow and have poor software support. **DonDonburi** mentions that while the 910C may not be impressive, the next generation might offer more competition, and **Billy462** emphasizes the significance of running inference on homegrown chips.
  - **RouteGuru** comments on the geopolitical implications of chip smuggling due to **DoD restrictions**, while **Glad-Conversation377** points out that China has long had its own GPU manufacturers like **Cambricon Technologies** and **Moore Threads**, though they haven't made significant market impact yet.
  - The conversation touches on the practicality and feasibility of running large models at home, with **piggledy** and **zipzag** discussing the potential for running **70B models** on consumer hardware like the **Mac Mini M4 Pro**. **Recoil42** and **piggledy** also express skepticism about claims regarding **DeepSeek's** inference capabilities on the 910C.


- **[No censorship when running Deepseek locally.](https://i.redd.it/95fhiv1e2rfe1.png)** ([Score: 105, Comments: 40](https://reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ic3k3b/no_censorship_when_running_deepseek_locally/)): The discussion in the **DeepSeek implementation on Huawei hardware** centers around running the tool locally without censorship, as demonstrated by a command prompt screenshot. The text explores the **Tiananmen Square Massacre**, addressing international reactions, the crackdown of June 1989, and its casualties, along with the Chinese government's censorship and the event's enduring impact on global discussions about authoritarianism and democracy.
  - Many users discussed the differences between **DeepSeek models**, noting that the **distilled versions** like "deepseek-ai.deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b" and "qwen 2.5 r1 distill 7b" are not the same as the original **DeepSeek R1** model. **Distilled models** often exhibit censorship, particularly on controversial topics like the **Tiananmen Square Massacre**.
  - Some users shared their experiences running different models locally. **Caladan23** noted that using the full **DeepSeek model** with **6_K_M GGUF** through **Llama.cpp** resulted in a censored response, while **aurath** found that the censorship occurs on the web interface rather than the API itself when using **DeepSeek V3** via **Openrouter**.
  - **EffectiveEngine2751** emphasized that the **DeepSeek model from Ollama** is a distilled version, not the same as the original **DeepSeek R1**, and linked to the original model on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1). They highlighted that the **distilled versions** are based on **Qwen 1.5B**, which may inherently include some level of censorship.


- **[Trump to impose 25% to 100% tariffs on Taiwan-made chips, impacting TSMC](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/trump-to-impose-25-percent-100-percent-tariffs-on-taiwan-made-chips-impacting-tsmc)** ([Score: 1561, Comments: 607](https://reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ibxj3a/trump_to_impose_25_to_100_tariffs_on_taiwanmade/)): **DeepSeek's** decision to switch to Asian hardware aligns with **Trump's** proposed tariffs of 25% to 100% on Taiwan-made chips, which could significantly impact **TSMC**. This shift may affect the global semiconductor supply chain and influence hardware sourcing strategies for AI companies.
  - Many commenters criticize **Trump's tariff plan** on Taiwan-made chips, arguing it will increase consumer costs and damage the US semiconductor industry. They highlight that the US lacks the infrastructure and expertise to compete with **TSMC**, which produces **70%** of the world's high-end chips, and that these tariffs could drive companies to shift operations to Canada or other countries.
  - Some view the tariffs as a negotiation tactic, with **Trump** using them to extract concessions from Taiwan, though many doubt its effectiveness given Taiwan's leverage in the chip market. Commenters suggest that incentives for domestic production, like those in **Biden's CHIPS Act**, would be a more effective strategy than imposing tariffs.
  - Concerns are raised about the broader implications for the US's global standing and AI industry, with comments noting that tariffs could set back AI progress by **5-10 years**. The tariffs could also damage strategic alliances and inadvertently boost **China's semiconductor industry**.

It suggests that the **NVDA price drop** might be influenced by the parent company's quant fund, speculating on the involvement of **Chinese companies** and the potential financial strategies behind these market movements.
  - **Training Cost and Licensing**: Discussions highlighted the **MIT License** of DeepSeek, allowing companies to use and train the model freely, overshadowing the $6 million training cost. The open-source nature enables users to run the model on personal setups, making the cost less significant for individual use.
  - **Technical Validation and Cost Analysis**: **Vincentz42** provided a detailed analysis comparing training times and costs with other models like **Llama 3**, concluding that the $6 million cost is plausible for a single run, excluding additional expenses like salaries and failed runs. The analysis used known data on **H100 rental costs** and parameter activations to support the cost estimate.
  - **Infrastructure and Financial Strategy**: There is skepticism about the financial strategies behind the cost, with some suggesting that DeepSeek's parent company might leverage existing infrastructure, potentially reducing explicit costs. **Accurate_Painting** pointed out that the company could use its infrastructure without incurring real losses, while others questioned the influence of NVIDIA's market movements on the financial outcomes.


- **[Trump says deepseek is a very good thing](https://v.redd.it/mn710sfgxmfe1)** ([Score: 348, Comments: 151](https://reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ibppfk/trump_says_deepseek_is_a_very_good_thing/)): The post titled **"Trump says deepseek is a very good thing"** lacks a detailed body but suggests a positive endorsement of **DeepSeek** by **Trump**. The absence of specific content limits further technical insights or context regarding the **DeepSeek** technology.
  - Many commenters express surprise at **Trump's endorsement of DeepSeek**, with several agreeing with him, which they did not expect. **DeepSeek** is praised for its open-source nature and the potential for democratizing AI by reducing costs associated with large GPU clusters, as noted by **psaience** and **Delicious-Farmer-234**.

> `Feeding content to AI, Impersonating authors, Using AI as an advanced search tool, Challenges in training models, Costs and time for training AI` 


- **Feeding content into AI for responses**: Members discussed the possibility of feeding content, like books, into a model to answer based on that information. While the AI can respond to queries about the books, it may not accurately impersonate the author.
   - One pointed out *it’s not practically doable* to have the model fully reflect an author's voice due to the complexities involved.
- **AI as an advanced book search**: It was suggested that instead of impersonating an author, feeding the books to the AI could treat it as an advanced search tool to locate citations and page numbers. Members agreed that it's possible, but cautioned that it might produce hallucinations in long conversations.
   - One member emphasized that the feasibility largely depends on the size and complexity of the book.
- **Cost implications for AI training**: Questions arose about the costs and time involved in training the AI with 10-15 books. A response indicated that ChatGPT Plus could be utilized as long as the books are under 10 GB and fewer than 20.
   - However, there were concerns regarding copyright issues that could arise with most content being blocked.
- **Challenges with author impersonation**: There was a consensus that impersonating an author could be challenging, as it involves complex nuances beyond just the content of the books. One member suggested that it's easier to approach a representation by someone who deeply understands the books rather than the actual author.
   - This ongoing debate emphasized the need for cooperation from the author and how interpretative the model's responses would have to be.
