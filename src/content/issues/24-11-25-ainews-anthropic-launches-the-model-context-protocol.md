> The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools. Similar to the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/), MCP how to integrate additional context and tools into the ecosystem of AI applications. For implementation guides and examples, visit modelcontextprotocol.io.

The protocol is flexible enough to cover: 


- **Resources**: [any kind of data](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/resources) that an MCP server wants to make available to clients. This can include:
File contents, 
Database records, 
API responses, 
Live system data, 
Screenshots and images, 
Log files, 
and more.
Each resource is identified by a unique URI and can contain either text or binary data.
- **Prompts**: Resuable templates and workflows (including multi-step)
- **Tools**: everything from [system operations to API integrations to running data processing tasks](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools#example-tool-patterns).
- **Transports**: Requests, Responses, and Notifications between clients and servers via JSON-RPC 2.0, including support for server-to-client streaming and other custom transports (WebSockets/WebRTC is not mentioned... yet)
- **Sampling**: allows servers to request LLM completions through the client, enabling sophisticated agentic behaviors  (including rating **costPriority, speedPriority, and intelligencePriority**, implying Anthropic will soon offer a model router) while maintaining security and privacy.
