  OpenAI launched realtime video capabilities for ChatGPT shortly after Google’s
  **Gemini 2.0 Flash**, which gained more attention due to lower cost and fewer
  rate limits. Meanwhile, **Meta’s Llama 3.3-70B** is praised for its advanced
  roleplay and persona adoption abilities, while **Microsoft’s Phi-4** small
  language model shows strong benchmark results but faces skepticism about
  real-world performance.

- **QRWKV6-32B Model boosts compute efficiency**: [Recursal AI](https://x.com/rohanpaul_ai/status/1866971776737218564) transformed the Qwen 32B Instruct model into the **QRWKV6** architecture, maintaining the original 32B performance while achieving **1000x compute efficiency** during inference.
   - This modification replaces transformer attention with **RWKV-V6 attention**, resulting in significant **cost reductions** in computation.
- **AMD GPUs enable rapid training**: Training of the QRWKV6 model was completed in just **8 hours** using **16 AMD MI300X GPUs** (192GB VRAM each), showcasing advancements in AI development speed.
   - Upcoming models like **Q-RWKV-6 72B** and **RWKV-7 32B** are in progress, promising enhanced capabilities.
- **RWKV-V6 Attention enhances scalability**: The linear attention mechanism in the QRWKV6 model proves to be highly efficient at scale, especially for processing long contexts.
   - Despite these improvements, the model's current context length is capped at **16k** due to compute constraints, though it remains stable beyond this limit.
- **Model transformation cuts retraining costs**: The conversion process allows transforming any QKV Attention model to an RWKV variant without the need for **full retraining**, thereby reducing compute costs.
   - However, the model inherits language limitations from the **Qwen model**, supporting only approximately **30 languages** compared to RWKV's typical **100+ languages**.
- **Community collaboration drives advancements**: Training for the QRWKV6 model is sponsored by **TensorWave**, with significant contributions from **EleutherAI** and the RWKV community.
   - While the transformation process is innovative, some details remain undisclosed, leaving the community curious about the **how-to** aspects.

- **Training Jacobian reveals parameter dependencies**: This new paper analyzes the **training Jacobian**, showing how final parameters depend on their initial values by transforming a small sphere in parameter space into an ellipsoid.
   - *Jacobian singular values* indicate stable and chaotic subspaces, with stability emphasized in the **bulk** region where parameters change minimally.
- **Bulk and chaotic subspaces identified**: The analysis divides the singular value spectrum into three regions: the **chaotic** region, a stable **bulk**, and a low-dimensional structure that varies with input data but not labels.
   - Training on **white noise** compressed the parameter space more aggressively than training on real data, highlighting its effects.
- **Computational challenges in Jacobian analysis**: Computing the entire training Jacobian is *computationally intractable* for larger networks, limiting in-depth analysis.
   - The study primarily used a **5K parameter MLP**, finding similar singular value trends in larger models, such as a **62K parameter image classifier**.
- **Explore upcoming research papers**: This paper is the first in a series on *neural network training dynamics* and **loss landscape geometry**.
   - Interested participants are encouraged to check the <#1052314857384460398> channel for further involvement.
- **Access paper and code**: The paper can be accessed through [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07003) and includes supplementary code hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/EleutherAI/training-jacobian).
   - The discussion included a [Twitter thread](https://x.com/norabelrose/status/1866943688993370381) that features insights from the paper and its implications.

- **Interesting Behavior with Hooks and Checkpointing**: A member reported encountering *interesting* behavior with forward and backward hooks when using **activation checkpointing**, where the forward hook prints twice during the backward pass.
   - They noted that the forward hook fires once without checkpointing, leading to confusion while rerunning due to the forward pass requirement.
- **External Variable to Track Backward Pass**: To address the forwarded behavior during backward pass, a member implemented an *external variable* that tracks whether it's the backward phase, setting it to **True** before `loss.backward()`.
   - This adjustment enables the forward hook to decide whether to execute its logic based on the variable's state.
- **Utilizing context_fn in Checkpointing**: Furthermore, another approach discussed involves using the `context_fn` argument in **checkpoint()** to manage behavior during backward passes.
   - This method allows customization of how the checkpoint function operates, potentially serving as an alternative to using an external variable.

> `CUDA Performance Checklist, Kernel Occupancy vs Duration` 


- **Understanding Kernel Occupancy vs Duration**: A member questioned why increasing the block size in the `copyDataCoalesced` kernel from **128** to **1024** led to better occupancy (**86%** compared to **76%**), yet resulted in increased duration from **500 microseconds** to **600 microseconds**.
   - *They expressed a lack of intuition regarding the performance drop even with better occupancy and requested insights on this observation.*
- **Insights on Performance Metrics**: Discussion emphasized the importance of breaking down performance metrics beyond occupancy, focusing on execution time and its correlation with block size in CUDA programming.
   - *Several members contributed thoughts on how memory access patterns influence performance, underscoring the complexity of optimizing for both occupancy and execution time.*

   - This conversion replaces transformer attention with **RWKV-V6 attention** through a novel method, ensuring significant **cost reductions in compute**.
- **Training speed impresses with AMD GPUs**: Training was completed in just **8 hours** using **16 AMD MI300X GPUs** (192GB VRAM each) for the QRWKV6 model, showcasing rapid development in AI.
   - Future models like **Q-RWKV-6 72B** and **RWKV-7 32B** are currently in progress, promising even greater capabilities.
- **Linear attention shows long-term promise**: The linear attention mechanism employed in the QRWKV6 model proves to be highly efficient at scale, particularly for processing long contexts.
   - Despite these advancements, the model's current context length is limited to **16k** due to compute constraints, yet it shows stability beyond this window.
- **Key highlights on model transformation**: The conversion process allows transforming any QKV Attention model to an RWKV variant without the need for **full retraining**, cutting down compute costs.
   - However, the model inherits language limitations from the **Qwen model**, only supporting approximately **30 languages** compared to RWKV's typical **100+ languages**.
- **Community collaboration sparks innovation**: The training for this model is sponsored by **TensorWave**, with notable contributions from **EleutherAI** and the RWKV community.
   - While the transformation process is groundbreaking, details on the inner workings may remain undisclosed, leaving some curious about the **how-to**.
