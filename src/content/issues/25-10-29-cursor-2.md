Today was the much rumored Cursor 2.0 launch day, with a characteristically tasteful [launch video](https://x.com/cursor_ai/status/1983567619946147967):

![Cursor 2.0 launch video showing the introduction of Composer, their first agent model for coding](https://resend-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/kwQFBeSOTVTgjZL)

When Sasha Rush [joined Cursor in March](https://x.com/srush_nlp/status/1902736199636205914), it became evident that Cursor was starting to train its own models, and [Cursor Composer](https://cursor.com/blog/composer) is the result. The central claim is frontier coding results with 4x faster speed:

![Cursor 2.0 launch video showing the introduction of Composer, their first agent model for coding](https://resend-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/fwO3BsfEFNM3ok1)

More than just a well received in-house model, Cursor 2.0 also offered an entire new tab within Cursor that is essentially a completely redesigned interface for managing Cursor agents rather than being primarily an IDE. The old IDE is still fully accessible, but the new Agents tab lets you go up one level of abstraction, and manage multiple agents at once.

![Cursor 2.0 launch video showing an interface for managing AI coding agents](https://resend-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/L9j0ITVm4DK9UqP)

There are a host of other notable smaller ships in 2.0, available in the [changelog](https://cursor.com/changelog/2-0). One of the more popular updates (previewed but now GA) is the [built in browser](https://x.com/cursor_ai/status/1983567626543734799).

![Cursor 2.0 launch screenshot showing a built-in browser for agents to run and test their code](https://resend-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/V3X4zKw3qkCBC3F)

A very well executed launch of a very comprehensive 2.0 of probably the most important AI IDE in the world.

   - Some speculate this is *to make it easier for devs, while harder for some*, or *to stop people bleeding probabilities out of the models for training* and that *reasoning models seemed to have killed* the need for these parameters.
- **AI Anxiety Grips Aspiring Assistants**: A web developer with **10 years** of experience expressed concern that **AI** will take their job, and a software engineer with **8 years** of experience advised to *learn AI tooling* and *sell what you're able to create*.
   - They advised to *be flexible to whatever employers need* and suggested discord servers that host paper talks.
- **GPT Worldview Warped by Western Wiles?**: Members are claiming that **GPT models** developed in the West are more aligned with **Western ideologies** due to the data they're trained on and models may have *meta awareness*.

- **KBLaM's Knowledge Base: Quality or Quagmire?**: Members debated [KBLaM's](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13837) context quality, with concerns that embeddings, being approximate, degrade quality compared to classic **RAGs**, even with refusal instruction tuning, and potential data-side prompt injections.
   - The sentiment is that *the compressed format will always have worse quality than the raw format*, and pointed out that SaaS industry consider that *AI application engineering is just spicy web programming* but **KBLaM** made use of refusal instruction tuning (*I don't know, sorry!*).
- **Temporal Optimax Tunes Towards Grandma Optimality**: A user shared a method called **Temporal Optimal Video Generation** using **Grandma Optimality** to enhance video generation quality by adjusting video speed and maintaining visual elements and also shared a system prompt example that instructs the model to reduce its response length to **50%** with a **4k token limit**, aiming for clear and concise outputs.
   - The user posited that poetry and rhymes could optimize prompt and context utilization, leading to a **temporal optimax variant** for video generation and referenced an [example on X](https://x.com/ditpoo/status/1982671389556392439) with the prompt *'Multiple fireworks bursting in the sky, At the same time, they all fly. Filling the sky with bloom lighting high'* and the model **Veo 3.1 fast**.

- **GPU Random Module Sparks Debate**: A member questioned the location of the faster GPU random module in `gpu/random.mojo`, noting that it doesn't depend on GPU ops and is slower than equivalent `c` rand calls.
   - It was suggested that the default `random` module should be cryptographic by default (something that most C implementations do not do) and thus slower for security reasons; a `random.fast_random` module could offer a faster, less secure implementation.
- **Property Testing Framework Coming Soon**: A member is working on adding a property-testing framework, which includes some RNG utilities as building blocks and is based on python‚Äôs Hypothesis, haskell‚Äôs Quickcheck, and Rust‚Äôs PropTest.
   - A bug was uncovered `var l = [1, 0]; var s = Span(l); s.reverse(); assert_equal(l, [0, 1])` that highlights the need for more tests, they also requested for the ability to generate values that break stuff (e.g. -1, 0, 1, DTYPE_MIN/MAX).
- **Navigating LayoutTensor Limitations for Tensor Networks**: A member is developing a tensor network library in Mojo, similar to numpy einsum, and is facing limitations with `LayoutTensor` due to its requirement for static layouts.
   - It was suggested to utilize [RuntimeLayout](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/kernels/layout/runtime_layout/RuntimeLayout/) or [Layout.make_shape_unknown](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/kernels/layout/layout/Layout#make_shape_unknown) to make parts of a static layout fallback to a runtime layout, although LayoutTensor doesn't support runtime ranks.
- **MLIR vs LLVM IR: A Compiler Development Dilemma**: Members discussed the use of MLIR and LLVM IR in Mojo, with one member asking whether MLIR is worth using and if it's possible to add a backend to an existing language using it.
   - It was mentioned that Mojo uses MLIR internally, and while inline MLIR has its challenges, it's valuable for compiler development and can lower to LLVM, and one company even uses MLIR to verilog.
- **Verdagon Blogpost on Mojo's Metaprogramming drops**: A member shared a new blog post about Mojo's metaprogramming capabilities, showcasing a motivating example for `MaybeComptime` and hardware specialization with cache line and page sizes.
   - There's excitement around the potential for `@parameter(enable_if=bool_expr)` to enable more advanced metaprogramming, along with the possibility of marking certain comptime values for "late" compilation or JIT.

   - The sentiment is that many sources are not available because *everyone always care about their own craft, which understandable why they didn't wanna give it to AI company* and also there a lot of though that quite amazing to achive different prespective but consider as harmful so it didn't get pass into the training.
- **KBLaM Debated as RAG Upgrade**: A member noted implementing an idea similar to [KBLaM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13837) but faced roadblocks, questioning its commonality due to its nature as a direct upgrade to **RAGs** and the perceived sufficient utility of existing **RAGs**.
   - They argued that AI-generated summaries, a core component of KBLaM, often have lower quality than source material, making it a potentially niche solution.
- **Business RAG Blossoming via MSPs**: A member reported showing a client how to whitelabel RAGFlow and that business **RAG** is becoming common, with most **TUI coding assistants** now capable of utilizing **RAG** via **MCP**.

- **Grandma Optimality Generates Temporal Optimal Videos**: A user shared a method called **Temporal Optimal Video Generation** using **Grandma Optimality** to enhance video generation quality by adjusting video speed and maintaining visual elements; see [examples on X](https://x.com/ditpoo/status/1982424252348260724).
   - The technique involves slowing the video to *2x speed*, maintaining visual quality, and can be applied to **LLMs** by adjusting output length and context consideration.
- **Optimize Prompts for Maximum Output**: The same user provided a system prompt example that instructs the model to reduce its response length to **50%** with a **4k token limit**, aiming for clear and concise outputs.
   - This technique is compared to an [example on X](https://x.com/ditpoo/status/1982424252348260724) from the early days of **GPT-4**, suggesting a method for better prompt engineering.
- **Image-to-Video is the Best Temporal Video Generation**: The same user suggested generating an image first and then converting it to video for best results in video generation.
   - The user noted that the **temporal optimized** video lasted *twice as long* (6s vs 3s), with more natural scene filling; the user speculates if more compute renders more complexity and accuracy.
- **Rhyming Optimizes Utilization**: The same user posited that poetry and rhymes could optimize prompt and context utilization, leading to a **temporal optimax variant** for video generation.
   - The user referenced an [example on X](https://x.com/ditpoo/status/1982671389556392439) with the prompt *'Multiple fireworks bursting in the sky, At the same time, they all fly. Filling the sky with bloom lighting high'* and the model **Veo 3.1 fast**.

> `KBLaM vs RAGs, AI Model Knowledge, Business RAG adoption, Data vulnerability issues` 


- **AI Models still lack World Knowledge**: A member suggested that even with **100 trillion tokens**, current AI models don't capture all the world's knowledge due to data filtering and access limitations.
   - They noted that much data remains untapped because creators are hesitant to share it with AI companies and some valuable perspectives are deemed *harmful* and excluded from training.
- **KBLaM faces Challenges vs RAGs**: A member tried implementing an idea similar to **KBLaM** months ago, but stopped due to practical problems when compared to existing **RAG** implementations.
   - They noted that AI-generated summaries often have *lower quality* than the source material, raising concerns about data storage methods, and the design choices introduce potential *data-side prompt injections*.
- **Business RAG sees Increased Adoption**: A member showed a Microsoft Service Provider how to **whitelabel RAGFlow**, indicating growing adoption of business **RAG**.
   - They mentioned that practically every **TUI coding assistant** can now utilize **RAG** via MCP, suggesting the rise of **RAG** in business and coding contexts.
- **KBLaM's Data Storage Compromises Quality**: A member questioned **KBLaM's** approach of converting all knowledge to embeddings, arguing that embeddings are *approximate* to the source material.
   - They state that this approximation issue does not occur with classic **RAGs**, as **RAGs** retain the full context and source material, unlike **KBLaM**'s compressed knowledge base.

> `MCP Registries, Tool's title` 


- **MCP Registries Clarified**: GitHub intends to integrate the [MCP Registry](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/) in a future iteration of their product, and **publishing to the MCP Registry** makes more sense for future-proofing.
   - GitHub and others will eventually pull from there as stated in this [GitHub blog post](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/meet-the-github-mcp-registry-the-fastest-way-to-discover-mcp-servers/).
- **GitHub's MCP Registry Defined**: Developers will be able to self-publish MCP servers directly to the OSS MCP Community Registry, and those servers will automatically appear in the **GitHub MCP Registry**, creating a unified, scalable path for discovery.
   - The [GitHub MCP Registry](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/how-to-find-install-and-manage-mcp-servers-with-the-github-mcp-registry/) has **44 servers** and will continue growing.

> `Global Notifications in MCP, MCP Transport Specification, Typescript SDK Bug, SSE stream discussion, Multiple Client Connections` 


- **MCP Spec Clarification needed for Global Notifications**: The Model Context Protocol (**MCP**) spec's wording on [multiple connections](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports#multiple-connections) led to confusion about whether notifications should be sent to all clients or just one.
   - The consensus is that *global notifications*, like **listChanged** or **resource subscriptions**, should be sent to all clients/subscribers, clarifying the spec's intent to avoid duplicate messages to a single client on multiple streams.
- **SSE Streams' Role in Global Notifications Explored**: The discussion clarified the use of **SSE streams**, distinguishing between the **GET stream** for general notifications and the **POST stream** for tool-related updates.
   - The GET stream should carry notifications like **list changes** and **subscription updates** to all clients, while tool-specific progress, results, and errors are sent via the POST stream.
- **Typescript SDK Discovered to Have Notification Bug**: A potential bug was identified in the [Typescript SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/blob/e74a358728991216391995e8daa5d0573614abc5/src/server/streamableHttp.ts#L727-L741) where change notifications are sent only on the current standalone stream.
   - This behavior is incorrect, as global notifications should be broadcast to all connected clients, necessitating a loop over all servers to ensure each client receives the update.
- **Server Singleton State Mechanism is Critical**: To properly manage global notifications, the server requires a **singleton state mechanism** to ensure all instances have access to the same data.
   - This mechanism allows each server instance to maintain a reference to subscribers and their associated transports, facilitating the broadcast of updates to all relevant clients.

   - One user mentioned moving their team from **Langchain** to **DSPy** after a bad experience preventing them from doing a model upgrade without completely starting from scratch on their prompts.
- **Model Upgrades can fail spectacularly**: It was noted that model upgrades (like **gpt-4o** to **4.1**) can fail spectacularly because prompt patterns change, and in such cases, the model just needs to be provided different instructions.
   - The user cited migrating away from Langchain because of this particular problem of prompt patterns.
- **Claude code web feature excludes MCPs**: A user linked to a [pull request](https://github.com/jmanhype/claude-code-plugin-marketplace/pull/1) and called MCPs a security issue (**BACKDOOR**) that **Anthropic** decided to exclude its functionality in their new **Claude** code web feature.
