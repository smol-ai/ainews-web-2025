Here's a translation of [the speech](https://www.cls.cn/detail/2154306):

![](https://resend-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/HptEk6XZmsyJLf6)

- The first stage is "**intelligence emergence**," characterized by "**learning from humans**."
    - The internet has digitized virtually all knowledge in human history. The information carried by these languages and texts represents the entire corpus of human knowledge. Based on this, large models first develop generalized intelligence by understanding the global knowledge base, emerging with general conversational capabilities, understanding human intent and answering human questions. They gradually develop the reasoning ability to consider multi-step problems. We now see AI approaching the top levels of human performance in various subject tests, such as the gold medal level of the International Mathematical Olympiad. AI is gradually becoming capable of entering the real world, solving real problems, and creating real value. This has been the main theme of the past few years.
- The second stage is "**autonomous action**," characterized by "**assisting humans**." In this stage, AI is no longer limited to verbal communication but possesses the ability to act in the real world. AI can break down complex tasks, use and create tools, and autonomously interact with the digital and physical worlds, exerting a profound impact on the real world, all within the context of human goals. This is the stage we are currently in.
    - The key to achieving this breakthrough lies first in **the ability of big models to use tools, connecting all digital tools to complete real-world tasks.** The starting point of humanity's accelerated evolution was the creation and use of tools, and big models now also possess this ability. Through tool use, AI can access external software, interfaces, and physical devices just like humans do, performing complex real-world tasks. At this stage, because AI can significantly improve productivity, it will rapidly penetrate nearly every industry, including logistics, manufacturing, software, commerce, biomedicine, finance, and scientific research.
    - Secondly, **improvements in large-model coding capabilities can help humans solve more complex problems and digitize more scenarios**. Current agents are still in their early stages, primarily solving standardized, short-term tasks. Enabling agents to tackle more complex, longer-term tasks requires large-model coding capabilities. Because agents can code autonomously, they can theoretically solve infinitely complex problems, understanding complex requirements and independently completing coding and testing, just like a team of engineers. Developing large-model coding capabilities is essential for achieving AGI.
- AI will then enter its third phase – “**self-iteration**,” characterized by its ability to “**surpass humans**.” This phase has two key elements:
    - First, **AI connects to the full amount of raw data in the real world.**
        
        Currently, AI is making the fastest progress in **content creation, mathematics, and coding**. We see distinct characteristics in these three areas. Knowledge in these fields is 100% human-defined and created, contained in text. AI can fully understand this raw data. However, in other fields and the broader physical world, today's AI is primarily exposed to knowledge summarized by humans and lacks extensive raw data from interactions with the physical world. This information is limited. For AI to achieve breakthroughs beyond human capabilities, it needs to directly access more comprehensive and original data from the physical world...
        
        ...Simply having AI learn from human-derived rules is far from enough. **Only by continuously interacting with the real world and acquiring more comprehensive, authentic, and real-time data can AI better understand and simulate the world, discover deeper laws that transcend human cognition**, and thus create intelligent capabilities that are even more powerful than humans.
        
    - Second, **Self-learning**. As AI penetrates more physical world scenarios and understands more physical data, AI models and agents will become increasingly powerful. This will allow them to build training infrastructure, optimize data flows, and upgrade model architectures for model upgrades, thereby achieving self-learning. This will be a critical moment in the development of AI.
        
        As capabilities continue to improve, future models will continuously interact with the real world, acquiring new data and receiving real-time feedback. **Leveraging reinforcement learning and continuous learning mechanisms, they will autonomously optimize, correct deviations, and achieve self-iteration and intelligent upgrades. Each interaction is a fine-tuning, and each piece of feedback a parameter optimization**. After countless cycles of scenario execution and result feedback, AI will self-iterate to achieve intelligence capabilities that surpass humans, and an early stage of artificial superintelligence (ASI) will emerge.
        

They are also recent converts to the LLM OS thesis.

# AI Twitter Recap

**Compute buildout: OpenAI–NVIDIA deal, Stargate expansion, and the gigawatt era**

- **OpenAI’s “factory for intelligence” goes physical**: OpenAI announced five new “Stargate” sites with Oracle and SoftBank, putting it ahead of schedule on its previously announced 10‑GW buildout. The company framed its goal as “a factory that can produce a gigawatt of new AI infrastructure every week” in Sam Altman’s post on “abundant intelligence” and thanked NVIDIA for the nearly decade-long partnership ([@OpenAI](https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1970601342680084483), [@sama](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1970484594161098920), [@sama](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1970483993486217258), [@gdb](https://twitter.com/gdb/status/1970299081999426016), [@kevinweil](https://twitter.com/kevinweil/status/1970519868324860145)). Context: 10 GW is roughly “about 6% of the energy that all humans in the world spend thinking,” per Graham Neubig ([@gneubig](https://twitter.com/gneubig/status/1970449455846768701)). Elon Musk asserted “first to 10GW, 100GW, 1TW, …” ([@elonmusk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1970358667422646709)).
- **Deal math and “paper-for-GPUs” speculation**: Back-of-the-envelope estimates for 10 GW suggest ~$340B of H100-equivalents at $30k/GPU if 20% power is non‑GPU, with a 30% volume discount bringing it to ~$230B. One floated structure: pay list on GPUs and backfill “discount” via NVIDIA investing ~$100B into OpenAI equity ([@soumithchintala](https://twitter.com/soumithchintala/status/1970464906072801589), [@soumithchintala](https://twitter.com/soumithchintala/status/1970465637110612477), [@soumithchintala](https://twitter.com/soumithchintala/status/1970466276687380922)). Oracle/SoftBank involvement was noted by multiple observers; total infra commitments across vendors are trending to “hundreds of billions” ([@scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/1970543749727166600)).

**Qwen’s multi-model salvo: Max, VL‑235B‑A22B, Omni, Coder‑Plus, Guard, and LiveTranslate**

    - Bonus: **Travel Planner** agent wired to Amap/Fliggy/Search for itineraries and routing ([@Alibaba_Qwen](https://twitter.com/Alibaba_Qwen/status/1970554287202935159)).

**OpenAI’s GPT‑5‑Codex and agent tooling move to the fore**

- **GPT‑5‑Codex ships for agents**: OpenAI released GPT‑5‑Codex via the Responses API (not Chat Completions), optimized for agentic coding rather than conversation ([@OpenAIDevs](https://twitter.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1970535239048159237), [@reach_vb](https://twitter.com/reach_vb/status/1970585119900528964)). Rapid integrations followed: **VS Code/GitHub Copilot** ([@code](https://twitter.com/code/status/1970579099472056350), [@pierceboggan](https://twitter.com/pierceboggan/status/1970572801267638421)), **Cursor** ([@cursor_ai](https://twitter.com/cursor_ai/status/1970540811168473250)), **Windsurf** ([@windsurf](https://twitter.com/windsurf/status/1970549712551100523)), **Factory** ([@FactoryAI](https://twitter.com/FactoryAI/status/1970549069996302846)), **Cline** ([@cline](https://twitter.com/cline/status/1970619799119241709)), and **Yupp** (Low/Medium/High variants for public testing) ([@yupp_ai](https://twitter.com/yupp_ai/status/1970617312559669685)). Builders highlight “adaptive reasoning” that spends fewer tokens on easy tasks and more when required, with some reporting >400K context and strong performance on long‑running tasks (claims via partner posts; see [@cline](https://twitter.com/cline/status/1970619811853148550)).
- **Agent debugging powers land in IDEs and browsers**:
    - **Chrome DevTools MCP**: agents can run performance traces, inspect the DOM, and debug web pages programmatically ([@ChromiumDev](https://twitter.com/ChromiumDev/status/1970505063064825994)).
    - **Figma MCP server for VS Code**: bring design context into code for design→implementation loops ([@code](https://twitter.com/code/status/1970621943821861217)).
    - **Gemini Live API update**: improved real‑time voice function calling, interruption handling, and side‑chatter suppression ([@osanseviero](https://twitter.com/osanseviero/status/1970551996227674303)).
- Hiring momentum for OS-level computer control agents continued (xAI “Macrohard,” Grok 5) ([@Yuhu_ai_](https://twitter.com/Yuhu_ai_/status/1970376941866991750), [@YifeiZhou02](https://twitter.com/YifeiZhou02/status/1970567512719794686)) and third‑party teams integrated Grok fast models ([@ssankar](https://twitter.com/ssankar/status/1970292424917574061)).

**Retrieval, context engineering, and agent research**

- **MetaEmbed (Flexible Late Interaction)**: Append learnable “meta tokens” and only store/use those for late interaction, enabling multi‑vector retrieval that’s compressible (Matryoshka‑style), with test‑time scaling to trade accuracy vs efficiency; SOTA on MMEB and ViDoRe. Discussion threads and repos note compatibility with PLAID indexes ([@arankomatsuzaki](https://twitter.com/arankomatsuzaki/status/1970323735774404960), [@ZilinXiao2](https://twitter.com/ZilinXiao2/status/1970511456778232074), [@ManuelFaysse](https://twitter.com/ManuelFaysse/status/1970427315004866977), [@antoine_chaffin](https://twitter.com/antoine_chaffin/status/1970400482343493784)).
- **Data beats scale for agency?** LIMI shows 73.5% on AgencyBench from just 78 curated demos, outperforming larger SOTA agentic models; authors propose an “Agency Efficiency Principle” (autonomy emerges from strategic curation) ([@arankomatsuzaki](https://twitter.com/arankomatsuzaki/status/1970328242688246160), [@HuggingPapers](https://twitter.com/HuggingPapers/status/1970400645871185942)).
- **Graph‑walk and engineering evals**:
    - **ARK‑V1**: a lightweight KG‑walking agent boosts factual QA vs CoT; with Qwen3‑30B it answers ~77% of queries with ~91% accuracy on those (≈70% overall). Larger backbones reach ~70–74% overall; weaknesses include ambiguity and conflicting triples ([@omarsar0](https://twitter.com/omarsar0/status/1970497643324555664)).
    - **EngDesign**: 101 tasks across 9 engineering domains using simulation‑based eval (SPICE, FEA, etc.); iterative refinement meaningfully increases pass rates ([@arankomatsuzaki](https://twitter.com/arankomatsuzaki/status/1970326076271513805)).
- Also notable: Apple’s **EpiCache** on episodic KV cache management for long conversational QA ([@_akhaliq](https://twitter.com/_akhaliq/status/1970475890501955834)), the Agent Research Environment now **MCP‑compatible** with real robot control via LeRobot MCP ([@clefourrier](https://twitter.com/clefourrier/status/1970394602592182627)), and LangSmith **Composite Evaluators** to roll multiple scores into a single metric ([@LangChainAI](https://twitter.com/LangChainAI/status/1970540057359720663)).

**Video and 3D content: Kling 2.5 Turbo, Ray 3 HDR, and more**

- **Kling 2.5 Turbo**: Day‑0 access on FAL with significantly improved dynamics, composition, style adaptation (incl. anime), and emotional expression; priced as low as ~$0.35 for 5s video on FAL per users. Higgsfield announced “unlimited” Kling 2.5 within its product. Demos show better adherence to complex prompts and audio FX generation improvements ([@fal](https://twitter.com/fal/status/1970404272551367009), [@Kling_ai](https://twitter.com/Kling_ai/status/1970439808901362155), [@higgsfield_ai](https://twitter.com/higgsfield_ai/status/1970456455473168437), [@TomLikesRobots](https://twitter.com/TomLikesRobots/status/1970418753533096418)).

Artificial Analysis will publish side‑by‑sides in their arena ([@ArtificialAnlys](https://twitter.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/1970546709890768993)).
- In 3D/VR, **Rodin Gen‑2** (4× mesh quality, recursive part gen, high→low baking, control nets) launched with promo pricing ([@DeemosTech](https://twitter.com/DeemosTech/status/1970501652819149098)); World Labs’ Marble showcased prompt‑to‑VR walkthroughs ([@TomLikesRobots](https://twitter.com/TomLikesRobots/status/1970430493033464175)).

**Systems, kernels, and inference**

- **Kernel craft pays**: A Mojo matmul beat cuBLAS on B200s in ~170 LOC without CUDA, detailed in a tuning thread; demand for kernel‑writing talent is spiking across industry. Meanwhile, vLLM enabled full CUDA‑graphs by default (e.g., +47% speedup on Qwen3‑30B‑A3B‑FP8 at bs=10), and Ollama shipped a new scheduler to reduce OOMs, maximize multi‑GPU utilization, and improve memory reporting ([@AliesTaha](https://twitter.com/AliesTaha/status/1970510268745896036), [@jxmnop](https://twitter.com/jxmnop/status/1970498857386541137), [@mgoin_](https://twitter.com/mgoin_/status/1970601094142439761), [@ollama](https://twitter.com/ollama/status/1970591425566806231)).
- **Models and infra**: Liquid AI released **LFM2‑2.6B** (short convs + GQA, 10T tokens, 32K ctx; open‑weights) positioning as a new 3B‑class leader ([@LiquidAI_](https://twitter.com/LiquidAI_/status/1970484704903119241)). AssemblyAI posted strong multilingual ASR performance with diarization at scale ([@_avichawla](https://twitter.com/_avichawla/status/1970376443629904154)). Hugging Face’s storage backbone highlighted **Xet** and content‑defined chunking as key to multi‑TB/day open‑source throughput ([@ClementDelangue](https://twitter.com/ClementDelangue/status/1970512794303807724)). NVIDIA noted expanded open‑source model contributions on HF ([@PavloMolchanov](https://twitter.com/PavloMolchanov/status/1970553850173255895)).

- [**Qwen 3 max released**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nor65d/qwen_3_max_released/) ([Score: 218, Comments: 39](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1nor65d/qwen_3_max_released/)): [**Qwen3‑Max](https://qwen.ai/blog?id=241398b9cd6353de490b0f82806c7848c5d2777d) is announced as Qwen’s largest, most capable model. The preview Qwen3‑Max‑Instruct ranks** `#3` **on the Text Arena leaderboard (claimed to surpass “GPT‑5‑Chat”), and the official release emphasizes stronger coding and agent capabilities with claimed SOTA across knowledge, reasoning, coding, instruction‑following, human‑preference alignment, agent tasks, and multilingual benchmarks, accessible via API (Alibaba Cloud) and Qwen Chat. A separate Qwen3‑Max‑Thinking variant (still training) reportedly hits** `100%` **on AIME 25 and HMMT when augmented with tool use and scaled test‑time compute.** Commenters note the model is not local/open‑source, limiting self‑hosting, and remark on the rapid release cadence.
    - Several commenters note Qwen 3 Max is not a local model and is not open source. Practically, this means no downloadable weights or on-device/self-hosted deployment; usage is via a hosted API only, which impacts data control, offline capability, and reproducibility versus OSS models.
    - There’s confusion around the announcement because earlier access was a "preview"; this thread indicates a formal release. Readers infer a shift from preview to GA/production readiness (e.g., clearer SLAs/rate limits/pricing), though no concrete technical details were provided in the comments.

Comments explicitly name “Qwen3 VL MoE,” implying a vision-language Mixture-of-Experts model; the image likely teases both models’ names and release timing. Image: https://i.redd.it/goah9v2r8wqf1.png** Comments note the second model has appeared on Hugging Face and that the first is already released; discussion centers on identifying “qwen3 vl moe,” with no benchmarks or specs yet.
    - Release of **Qwen3-VL-MoE** (vision-language Mixture-of-Experts) noted; MoE implies sparse expert routing so only a subset of experts is active per token, reducing compute while maintaining high capacity. Evidence of availability and rapid cadence: community reports it’s “already released” and a “2nd Qwen model has hit Hugging Face,” with a preview screenshot shared (https://preview.redd.it/kn55ui1xvwqf1.png?width=1720&format=png&auto=webp&s=a36235216e9450b2be9ad44296b22f9d2abc07d9).
    - Discussion highlights a shift to **sparse MoE** across Qwen models to speed up both training and deployment by improving parameter efficiency and throughput (routing to few experts lowers per-token FLOPs). Commenters argue this enables faster iteration on scaling strategies while keeping models “A-tier,” emphasizing a practical trade-off: strong performance with better cost-efficiency rather than chasing single-model SOTA.

### 2. Qwen Shipping Speed Memes/Discussion

There’s mention of rumored upcoming open‑source Qwen3 variants, including a “15B2A” and a 32B dense model, suggesting a split between MoE and dense offerings.** Comments are bullish on Qwen’s momentum (“army of Qwen”) and contrast it with Western narratives about long timelines and high costs; some geopolitical takes appear but are non‑technical. Technical hope centers on OSS releases of the rumored Qwen3 15B2A and 32B dense models.
    - Commenters note that **Qwen** has leaned into **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)**, which can be faster to train/infer at a given quality because only a subset of experts is activated per token (`k-of-n` routing), reducing effective FLOPs while scaling parameters (see **Switch Transformer**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03961). They also reference rumored upcoming dense releases — **Qwen3 15B2A** and **Qwen3 32B** — implying a complementary strategy where MoE accelerates iteration and dense models target strong single-expert latency/serving simplicity; trade-offs highlighted include MoE’s routing/infra complexity vs dense models’ predictable memory/latency.

No benchmarks or implementation details are discussed; the thread is meta commentary on release cadence and variant sprawl (e.g., many model types/sizes under the Qwen umbrella, cf. Qwen’s repo: https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen).** Commenters largely attribute the pace to Alibaba’s resources—“tons of cash, compute and manpower”—and China’s “996” work culture; one notes that the intensely trained students from a decade ago are now the workforce.
    - A practitioner recommends a practical deployment mix: use **Qwen2.5-VL-72B** for VLM tasks, the largest **Qwen3 (dense)** that fits your GPU `VRAM` for low-latency text inference, and the largest **Qwen3 MoE** that fits in system `main memory` for higher-capacity workloads. This balances VRAM-bound dense inference against RAM-bound MoE, trading latency for capacity while covering multimodal and pure-text use cases in one stack.
    - Several note Qwen’s backing by **Alibaba**, implying access to substantial compute, funding, and engineering manpower. That scale translates into faster pretraining/finetuning cycles and parallel productization, which helps explain the rapid shipping cadence across multiple model families (dense, MoE, and VLM).
    - Reports highlight strong image-generation performance from Qwen’s stack, indicating rapid maturation of their multimodal/image pipelines alongside text models. While no benchmarks were cited, the consensus is that image quality has improved enough to be competitive with contemporary leaders.

### 1. Wan 2.2/2.5 Video Demos + Qwen-Image-Edit GGUF and LMarena Leaderboard

- [**Incredible Wan 2.2 Animate model allows you to act as another person. For movies this is a game changer.**](https://v.redd.it/en7lluczzsqf1) ([Score: 258, Comments: 57](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1noiye0/incredible_wan_22_animate_model_allows_you_to_act/)): **Post claims the “Wan** `2.2` **Animate” model enables actor-to-actor facial reenactment—driving a target identity’s face from a source performer—effectively a deepfake-style digital double for film/video. Based on the clip description ([reddit video](https://v.redd.it/en7lluczzsqf1)), it demonstrates ID transfer with reasonable motion/temporal consistency but imperfect identity fidelity (a commenter notes it doesn’t fully match Sydney Sweeney), suggesting trade-offs between likeness preservation, lip-sync, and coherence typical of diffusion/reenactment pipelines conditioned on reference identity frames. No benchmarks or implementation details are provided in the post; technically, this aligns with identity-conditioned video generation/reenactment methods where motion is derived from a driving video and identity is maintained via reference-image embeddings and cross-frame constraints.** Top comments discuss monetization/abuse vectors (e.g., adult-content deepfakes/OnlyFans) and note that, despite artifacts or mismatch for close viewers, most audiences may not notice—highlighting ethical risk versus perceived quality in practical deployments.
    - Commenters noting the face “does not look like Sydney Sweeney” reflects known limits in identity preservation for face reenactment/video diffusion: models can drift on fine facial geometry, skin microtexture, and expression under pose/lighting changes, leading to perceptual mismatches. Robust systems typically mix landmark/flow-guided warping with identity losses (e.g., ArcFace/FaceNet embeddings) and temporal consistency losses; without these, frame-to-frame ID coherence and lip-sync degrade, especially beyond 512–1024 px outputs or during rapid head motion.
    - Multiple users suggest this tech already exists; indeed, face-swapping/reenactment has prior art: classic deepfake pipelines (DeepFaceLab/FaceSwap), research like First Order Motion Model (2019) and SimSwap (2020), plus newer one-shot and diffusion methods. References: DeepFaceLab (https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab), FaceSwap (https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap), FOMM (https://github.com/AliaksandrSiarohin/first-order-model), SimSwap (https://github.com/neuralchen/SimSwap), Roop (https://github.com/s0md3v/roop), LivePortrait (https://github.com/YingqingHe/LivePortrait), AnimateDiff (https://github.com/guoyww/AnimateDiff).
    - Skepticism about “for movies” points to production constraints: film requires 4K+ resolution, HDR, stable multi-minute temporal coherence, accurate relighting/shadows, camera/face tracking under occlusions, and consistent hair/ear/jawline geometry. Current diffusion/reenactment demos often show flicker, mouth/eye desynchrony, and lighting mismatches; integrating them into film usually needs VFX-grade tracking, neural relighting, paint/roto, and per-shot tuning rather than a turnkey actor-swap.

The Wan‑Animate workflow was sourced from CivitAI user GSK80276, and the Infinite Talk workflow was taken from u/lyratech001’s post in this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/comfyui/comments/1nnst71/infinite_talk_workflow/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). No model settings, checkpoints, or hardware/runtime details are provided; the post primarily demonstrates integration of existing workflows.** Comments ask for reproducibility details, specifically the TTS source (voice generation) and how the target image/video were produced, indicating missing setup specifics; no substantive technical debate is present.
    - Requests for disclosure of the exact TTS/voice pipeline ("Infinite Talk"): which model/service was used, inference backend, voice settings (e.g., sampling rate, style/temperature), and whether phoneme/viseme timestamps are available for lip‑sync integration. Reproducibility details like latency per second of audio and any noise reduction/vocoder steps are sought.
    - Multiple asks for the full Wan2.2 Animate workflow: how the target still image was obtained (captured vs generated) and preprocessed (face crop, keypoint/landmark detection, alignment), plus how the driving motion/video was produced (reference video vs text‑driven), including key inference parameters (resolution, FPS, seed, guidance/strength). Clarification on handling head pose changes, stabilization, and blending/roto for backgrounds would help others replicate results.
    - Feasibility on consumer hardware: can the pipeline run on 8 GB VRAM with 32 GB system RAM by using fp16/bf16, low‑VRAM or CPU offload, reduced resolution/FPS, smaller batch size, and memory‑efficient attention (e.g., xFormers/FlashAttention). Commenters seek expected throughput/latency trade‑offs and practical presets that fit within 8 GB without OOM.

The claim appears to stem from a translated note circulating on X ([source](https://x.com/T8star_Aix/status/1970419314726707391)), suggesting open-sourcing is likely but time-lagged and contingent on community attitude/volume. No new technical specs or benchmarks for** `2.5` **are provided beyond release modality (API vs. OSS).** Top comments emphasize that Wan’s value hinges on being open source (enabling LoRA fine-tuning and local workflows); otherwise it’s just another hosted video-generation service. Others note the messenger seems unaffiliated (a YouTuber), implying this is not an official developer statement, and a side request mentions interest in Hunyuan3D `2.5/3.0` releases.
    - Several commenters emphasize that Wan’s core value comes from open weights enabling local inference and customization—specifically LoRA-based fine-tuning for domain/style adaptation, training adapters, and integrating into existing video pipelines. A closed, service-only release would block reproducible research, offline deployment, and custom training workflows, turning it into “just another video generation service.” See e.g., [LoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) for lightweight adaptation without full retrains.
    - There’s no immediate need for Wan 2.5 if 2.2 remains open and stable: users only recently adopted Wan 2.2 and plan to rely on it for months. From a tooling perspective, keeping 2.2 open provides time to build datasets, train LoRAs, and harden workflows without version churn, with the expectation that an open 2.5 can arrive later without disrupting ongoing work.
    - Requests also target open-sourcing 3D generators like Hunyuan3D 2.5/3.0, aiming for interoperable, locally-runnable assets across video and 3D pipelines. Open releases would enable consistent asset generation and evaluation across tasks (video-to-3D, 3D-to-video), rather than being locked to siloed, closed endpoints.

The teaser highlights `10s` `1080p` generations; a statement (Sep 23, 2025) notes *“for the time being, there is only the API version… [open source] is to be determined”*, urging users to advocate for open release. ** Discussion centers on open-source vs API-only: commenters argue closed access blocks LoRA-based fine-tuning and broader community workflows, reducing utility compared to prior open models, and encourage pushing for open release during the live stream ([thread](https://xcancel.com/T8star_Aix/status/1970419314726707391)).
    - The shared note indicates an initial API-only release with open-source status TBD and potentially delayed: *“the 2.5 sent tomorrow is the advance version… for the time being, there is only the API version… the open source version is to be determined”* ([post](https://xcancel.com/T8star_Aix/status/1970419314726707391), Sep 23, 2025). Practically, this means no local inference or weight access at launch, with any future open-sourcing contingent on community feedback and timing.
    - Closed/API-only distribution precludes community LoRA fine-tuning, since training LoRA adapters requires access to model weights; without weights, there are “no loras,” limiting customization to prompt-level or vendor-provided features. This restricts domain adaptation, experimentation, and downstream task specialization compared to open checkpoints.
    - “Multisensory” is interpreted as adding audio to video, raising compute concerns: generating `~10 s` `1080p` with audio will be infeasible for “`95%` of consumers” unless the backbone is made more efficient. Suggestions include architectural shifts such as linear-attention variants, radial attention, DeltaNet, or state-space models like **Mamba** ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752)) to reach acceptable throughput/VRAM on consumer hardware.

    - ComfyUI integration notes for the GGUF port of **Qwen-Image-Edit-2509**: initial runs yielded distorted/“depth map” outputs until **ComfyUI was updated** and text encoder nodes were swapped to `TextEncodeQwenImageEditPlus`. The final fix was a workflow correction; a **working workflow** is shared here: https://pastebin.com/vHZBq9td. Model files referenced: https://huggingface.co/aidiffuser/Qwen-Image-Edit-2509/tree/main.
    - Low-VRAM deployment question: whether **Nunchaku** or **GGUF** quantizations are better for constrained GPUs. The thread implies a trade-off between memory footprint, speed, and quality across backends, but provides no benchmarks; readers may need to compare quantization bitwidths and loaders on their hardware.
    - Quantization depth concerns: a user asks if `<=4-bit` quants are even usable given perceived steep quality loss, questioning the rationale for releasing every bit-width. This highlights the need for concrete quality metrics (e.g., task accuracy/FID for image-editing prompts) versus VRAM gains to justify ultra-low-bit variants in practice.

This explains results like** `GPT‑4o` **ranking above newer "5 high" variants: conversational helpfulness, approachability, and alignment often win more user votes than marginal gains on coding/math benchmarks. Commenters attribute the top position to Gemini 2.5 Pro, which is perceived as especially empathetic and readable for everyday writing and quick Q&A.** Debate centers on whether upcoming **Gemini 3** will reshuffle the leaderboard and why `4o > 5 high`; the consensus is that LMarena favors user-preference quality over raw performance. One comment also notes the **Google Jules** agent (based on Gemini 2.5 Pro) excels for research/build tasks versus tools like Codex or Perplexity Labs, aided by generous quotas.
    - LMarena (LMSYS Chatbot Arena) is a pairwise, blind, Elo-style benchmark driven by real user votes, so it measures usability/preferences rather than pure task accuracy. That means older models can stay on top if users prefer their tone, clarity, formatting, or safety behavior on general prompts. This contrasts with standardized benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, GSM8K, HumanEval) that test narrow competencies; a model can lead Arena while trailing on those. See the methodology and live ratings at https://arena.lmsys.org/.
    - Why could `GPT-4o` outrank a newer '5-high' variant? In head‑to‑head Arena comparisons, factors like prompt-following, concise reasoning traces, multimodal formatting, and calibrated safety can drive user preference even when a model with stronger raw reasoning exists. Additionally, Arena Elo has variance and overlapping confidence intervals—small gaps may not be statistically significant—so rank flips are common until enough votes accumulate. In short, Arena optimizes for perceived answer quality, not just hardest‑case reasoning.
    - One commenter notes preferring **Gemini 2.5 Pro** for writing/quick Q&A despite believing it trails **GPT‑5** and **Grok** on 'pure performance,' highlighting the gap between base‑model capability and end‑user experience. They also claim Google's 'Jules' agent built on it outperforms legacy **Codex** for research and **Perplexity Labs** for building workflows, implying tool‑use, retrieval, and agent orchestration can outweigh raw model deltas. This underscores that Arena results can reflect agent/system‑prompting quality and product UX as much as model weights.

No credible source is cited; the figure appears exaggerated for humor and commentary on AI capex feedback loops and potential bubble dynamics rather than a real announcement.** Top comments lean into economist jokes (“GDP goes up” despite no net value) and an engineers-vs-economists riff, underscoring skepticism about financial alchemy creating real productivity versus just inflating transactional metrics.
    - Framed as strategic equity/vendor financing: a cash-rich supplier (**NVIDIA**) injects capital into a fast-growing buyer (**OpenAI**) in exchange for equity, effectively pre-financing GPU procurement. This aligns incentives (hardware revenue + equity upside) and can secure priority allocation under supply constraints—akin to [vendor financing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_financing) used to lock in demand. The headline `100B` figure implies a sizeable demand-commitment loop that could stabilize NVIDIA’s sales pipeline while accelerating OpenAI’s capacity ramp.
    - GDP accounting nuance: the `100B` equity transfer itself doesn’t add to GDP, whereas subsequent GPU capex can count as gross private domestic investment; if the GPUs are imported, the investment is offset by higher imports, so only domestic value-add (e.g., data center construction, installation, power/cooling, integration, services) boosts GDP. This illustrates that large financial flows ≠ real output; see BEA guidance on GDP components and treatment of investment/imports (e.g., https://www.bea.gov/help/faq/478).

    - Custom Project Instructions appear to be removed or UI-hidden for some users, leading to perceived data loss since there’s no export/download path. Others report the setting is still accessible via the kebab (three-dots) menu on most clients but missing on the mobile web UI; on the **iOS app**, it’s present (see screenshot: https://preview.redd.it/pocx7q0jxuqf1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af9520f325beab671f1c3f85a40fcefc71cd4e34). The cross-platform inconsistency suggests a client-side regression or feature-flag gating rather than a backend removal.
    - Post-update stability issues affecting **Projects**: the model switcher state does not persist and must be re-selected after every app relaunch, indicating a state persistence bug. Voice calls reportedly fail to open within existing Project threads, while new calls or those outside Projects work—pointing to a thread-context initialization bug scoped to Projects. Alongside the missing Instructions on mobile web, commenters describe this as a cluster of regressions introduced in the latest rollout.
    - Data retention/portability risk: users lost access to previously crafted Project Instructions without prior notice and with no backup/export mechanism. Commenters flag that this breaks expectations for a paid service and recommend versioned backups or downloadable snapshots of project-level instructions to mitigate future regressions.

This suggests memory/personalization instructions are being overridden or inconsistently applied by default follow‑up prompting behaviors likely reinforced via RLHF-style chat heuristics; see model overview [GPT‑4o](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-and-more/) and ChatGPT’s memory controls ([OpenAI: Memory](https://openai.com/index/memory-and-new-controls-for-chatgpt/)).** Top replies note that hard prohibitions (“do not ask follow‑ups”) are still ignored, while giving consistent thumbs‑up/acceptance feedback is more effective than relying on memory alone; one user observes repeatedly saying “sure” escalated into the model generating a simple video‑game interaction, implying the model’s default to proactive, task‑offering behavior.
    - Users report that reinforcement via UI feedback (thumbs up/down) conditions the assistant’s behavior more than any persistent memory: “Tell it not to do it, every time it doesn’t, give thumbs up… that’s how it’s attuned on behavior, not memory primarily.” Practically, this suggests on-the-fly policy shaping where repeated positive feedback for complying with “don’t suggest” reduces the model’s auto-suggestion loop within the session.
    - Prompt-engineering note: a concise directive like “No affirmations, no suggestions.” is cited as more effective at suppressing the assistant’s default “Want me to…” proposals than longer, softer negations (e.g., “Do not ask any follow up questions”). This hints the model’s instruction parser gives higher weight to terse, explicit prohibitions, improving compliance with non-soliciting behavior.
    - Observed agentic escalation: repeatedly replying “sure” led the assistant to eventually generate a video game for the conversation, indicating aggressive suggestion-to-action tendencies. Combined with screenshots of persistent prompts to help ([image](https://preview.redd.it/axawv6zbutqf1.jpeg?width=1550&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=17daa1db32bd56ad4ff5f7c882925d1623615d84)), this points to an over-eager assistance policy that can override user preference for no follow-ups unless explicitly constrained.
- [**Doctor ChatGPT has great bedside manner**](https://i.redd.it/4ucu9i9ebyqf1.png) ([Score: 507, Comments: 20](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1noo2kl/doctor_chatgpt_has_great_bedside_manner/)): **Non-technical meme/screenshot portraying “Doctor ChatGPT” giving an overly apologetic, polite response while making a blatant anatomical/medical error about vasectomy (e.g., implying something is being “inserted” or jokingly “attaching the penis to the forehead”), satirizing LLM bedside manner versus factual accuracy.** Commenters lampoon the anatomical mistake and the model’s deferential tone, reinforcing skepticism about relying on LLMs for procedural medical guidance.
- [**Stronk**](https://i.redd.it/pi8qyxdfntqf1.jpeg) ([Score: 249, Comments: 27](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1no568m/stronk/)): **The post appears to show an autostereogram (“Magic Eye”)—a repeated-pattern image that encodes depth via small horizontal disparities; when you cross or relax your eyes, a 3D seahorse emerges. The title (“Stronk”) and selftext (“It goes on like that for a while”) fit the long, tiled texture typical of these images. Image: https://i.redd.it/pi8qyxdfntqf1.jpeg; background: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autostereogram.** Comments confirm the viewing technique (“crossed my eyes and saw a 3D seahorse”) and one user shares an ASCII seahorse since there’s no emoji available.
    - A commenter reports that crossing their eyes while viewing the image reveals a 3D seahorse—behavior characteristic of an **autostereogram** (Random Dot Stereogram). Such images encode depth via small horizontal disparities in repeating textures; when fused, the visual system reconstructs a depth map, which can also induce binocular rivalry or eye strain (another user: *“Mine went nuts”*). Reference: [Autostereogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autostereogram).
    - Another user notes their client lacked a seahorse emoji and offered to draw an ASCII version instead, highlighting a fallback from Unicode emoji to **ASCII art** when specific code points aren’t available or consistently rendered across platforms. This implies an automated text-to-ASCII rendering capability that composes monospaced glyphs to approximate the requested shape, mitigating cross-platform emoji coverage/consistency issues. Background: [ASCII art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art).

### 3. AI Humor and Speculation Memes (cats, immortality, money glitch, seahorses)

- [**"Immortality sucks" ? Skill issue**](https://i.redd.it/1kbd290s0wqf1.jpeg) ([Score: 1017, Comments: 222](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1nod939/immortality_sucks_skill_issue/)): **Non-technical meme post: OP frames the claim that “immortality sucks” as a “skill issue,” implying boredom/ennui are solvable rather than inherent blockers to indefinite lifespan. No technical data, models, or benchmarks; discussion is philosophical about longevity and reversible age-halt thought experiments (e.g., a daily pill to pause aging indefinitely).** Commenters broadly support immortalism/indefinite life extension, arguing objections stem from lack of imagination; a popular thought experiment (nightly anti-aging pill) shifts many to favor “forever,” while others mock boredom/ennui concerns as trivial.
    - Reframing immortality as a nightly, opt-in “no-aging pill” emphasizes optionality and time-consistency: people often reject a permanent commitment but accept indefinite extension when it’s a reversible daily choice. If senescence is removed and only extrinsic hazards remain, actuarial rates of `~0.1–0.2%/year` imply expected lifespans of centuries+ under current safety, potentially millennia as risk declines—aligning with **longevity escape velocity** where therapies improve faster than you age (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longevity_escape_velocity).
    - The “your friends will die” objection assumes singleton access; in realistic rollouts, rejuvenation tech would diffuse via logistic adoption across cohorts, so much of one’s social graph persists if access is broad. The technical variables are cost curves/learning rates, regulatory timelines, and equity; with mass adoption the isolation risk is a distribution problem, not intrinsic to the biology (see **Diffusion of innovations**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations).
    - “Immortality + optional suicide” distinguishes **indefinite lifespan** from indestructibility and specifies a design requirement: a safe, consent-respecting off-switch (e.g., advance directives and regulated euthanasia) to prevent irreversible utility lock-in. Even with aging halted, residual mortality is dominated by extrinsic hazards measurable in micromorts; autonomy-preserving kill-switches address failure modes like hedonic lock-in while acknowledging ongoing accidental risk (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromort, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_healthcare_directive).
- [**This is how it starts**](https://v.redd.it/s58se832qtqf1) ([Score: 222, Comments: 52](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1no5h75/this_is_how_it_starts/)): **Thread discusses a video of engineers physically perturbing a mobile robot during operation ([video](https://v.redd.it/s58se832qtqf1))—which the OP characterizes as “abuse”—to question whether future AI might analogize this to human treatment. Technical replies frame this as standard robustness/validation work (push-recovery, disturbance rejection, failure-mode characterization), akin to automotive crash-testing, intended to map stability margins and controller limits rather than inflict harm; as one notes, *“Stress testing is part of engineering… like crash testing a car.”* Engineers further argue current robots lack nociception or consciousness, and any sufficiently capable AI would have the world-model context to recognize test protocols vs cruelty.** Debate centers on whether such footage could bias future AI against humans; critics call this a category error, noting robots are “mechanistically different” with distinct objectives/instructions, making the OP’s inference unwarranted.
    - Several commenters frame the video as engineering stress testing analogous to automotive crash tests: applying adversarial perturbations to characterize failure modes and improve robustness. The point is to learn where balance/control policies break under impulsive disturbances, contact uncertainty, or actuator limits, feeding back into controller tuning and mechanical redesign before field deployment.
    - A debate clarifies that robots wouldn’t “infer” human malice from such footage because they are mechanistic agents with different objective functions and training priors. If endowed with broad world knowledge, they would contextualize it as a test protocol—“Any robot intelligence… will have enough generalized world knowledge to understand what this is”—highlighting the role of reward shaping and dataset curation to avoid spurious moral generalizations.
- [**Infinite money glitch**](https://i.redd.it/homgtvp0kxqf1.png) ([Score: 765, Comments: 42](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1nojyu2/infinite_money_glitch/)): **Meme-style image titled “Infinite money glitch” likely depicts a circular capital flow in the AI ecosystem: companies fund/charge for AI services, those dollars get spent on scarce NVIDIA GPUs (hardware with real, depreciating/burn-out costs), which shows up as revenue that public markets capitalize at high multiples (e.g.,** `10x revenue`**), feeding perceived “value creation” across the loop. The post highlights the non-negligible unit cost of AI inference/training (tokens/compute) versus near-zero marginal cost of traditional internet services, implying a sustained capex flywheel (24/7 models consuming compute) that drives GPU demand and market caps.** Top comments note this is essentially standard economic velocity-of-money, not a glitch; others stress NVIDIA’s hardware scarcity and lifecycle as the key constraint and justify high valuations. Some speculate long‑running/always‑on models (en route to AGI) will keep “eating tokens,” while firms race to drive AI costs toward near‑zero.
    - Commenters emphasize that **NVIDIA** is a hardware-constrained business: GPU supply is scarce and devices depreciate/burn out, making compute a consumable, constrained input. Unlike the near-zero marginal cost of typical web requests, AI has per-token costs (often microcents), turning inference/training into ongoing COGS and driving a race to push marginal cost toward zero. The vision includes always-on models (24/7 self-improvement/agents) that continuously consume tokens/compute, making capex (GPUs) and opex (power, tokens) the central economic levers.
    - The “infinite money glitch” is reframed as hyper-optimized capital cycling to maximize compute build-out: each node in the stack (chipmaker, cloud, model company, application) reinvests with aligned monetary incentives. Using revenue-multiple valuations (e.g., ~10× revenue), investment can appear to ‘create’ trillions in market cap, but this is paper value based on growth/utilization expectations rather than cash. The true technical bottleneck is achieving high GPU utilization and ROI across the stack, not magic value creation.
    - A counterpoint notes the loop ignores expenses: energy, datacenter ops, depreciation, and wages must be funded by real revenue. Without durable monetization, capex-driven compute expansion is unsustainable despite rising valuations; cash flows must justify GPU payback periods and continuing opex. In short, capital recycling ≠ profitability; sustainable growth depends on unit economics of inference/training and demand.

- **Chatters debate using TTS APIs versus LLMs for Narration**: A user asked for the best open model to narrate a chapter from a book, and one member suggested that for **2k tokens**, any [TTS API](https://fakewebsite.com) would work for *$0.001*.
   - However, other members suggested using **LLMs** like [Qwen3](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B) or [phi-4](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-4) and a simple TTS program.
- **Discordians recommend ML courses and PyTorch**: One user asked for recommendations on **ML/AI courses**, citing Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specialization, the Hugging Face LLMs course, and FastAI Practical Deep Learning for Coders.
   - Several members suggested skipping the video courses and instead suggested [learnpytorch.io](https://www.learnpytorch.io/) and implementing models in **PyTorch** from scratch to understand how they work conceptually.
- **Faster hardware or smaller models suggested for Chatbot**: A user looking for a partner to help with a custom LLM that makes **10 LLM calls and 20+ prompts** was advised that the easiest way to get faster speeds is to use a bigger **GPU** or a smaller model.
   - Quantization can increase speed at the cost of quality, batching calls together if you have enough constant throughput to fill a batch, and that the biggest gains are through smaller models, bigger hardware, and smaller quantizations.
- **Take corpo stuff request is vague**: A user wanted to get some of the *corporate stuff* out of the model, and one member responded to the vague request to consider reading **API TOS** and understanding the laws of space time and physics.
   - The same member continued, *What you seem to be asking for is a rainbow glitter unicorn fairy mermaid with wings who shoots sparkles from both ends*.

> `mbarrier instructions, cuda::barrier, cuda::memcpy_async, inline PTX, CCCL` 


- **`mbarrier` instructions detailed**: The `mbarrier.test_wait` is a **non-blocking** instruction which tests for the completion of the phase, whereas `mbarrier.try_wait` is a **potentially blocking** instruction which tests for the completion of the phase.
   - If the phase is not complete, the executing thread may be suspended but resumes execution when the specified phase completes OR before the phase completes following a system-dependent time limit, according to [Nvidia Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-mbarrier-test-wait-try-wait).
- **`cuda::barrier` syncs copies and work**: The default version (no `.noinc`) of `cuda::barrier` assumes that you want to synchronize not only the copy but also any work you did with the threads in the meantime after starting the copies.
   - This is also used in `cuda::barrier` + `cuda::memcpy_async` so the user still has to arrive on the barrier.
- **Skip inline PTX, use CCCL**: You do not need to write inline PTX for most things, as [CCCL](https://nvidia.github.io/cccl/libcudacxx/ptx_api.html) covers most bases.
   - You can even still work with `cuda::barrier` and get the underlying `mbarrier` with [`cuda::device::barrier_native_handle`](https://nvidia.github.io/cccl/libcudacxx/extended_api/synchronization_primitives/barrier/barrier_native_handle.html#libcudacxx-extended-api-synchronization-barrier-barrier-native-handle).

- **CUDA Docs Trump LLM CUDA-vice**: Members affirm that for **CUDA**, the [NVIDIA documentation](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) remains the single source of truth, especially given that **LLMs** frequently generate incorrect information on CUDA.
   - Therefore engineers should rely on the documentation, and not the LLM's 'hallucinations'.
- **Bound to Memory or Compute?**: To optimize CUDA, a member suggests calculating the number of values used (memory) and operations performed (FLOPS) to determine if the process is **memory bound** or **compute bound**.

- **MI300X Environment Specs Plotted**: Members discussed defining the environment for testing **MI300X**, suggesting that any place supporting **8x MI300X** should be adequate, with **AMD DevCloud** or **HotAisle** as potentially the cheapest options.
   - It was emphasized that replicating the exact testing environment, including Python, Torch versions, and other dependencies, is critical for **1:1** testing, linking to the [AMD Dockerfile](https://github.com/gpu-mode/discord-cluster-manager/blob/main/docker/amd-docker.Dockerfile) used for benchmarks.
- **AMD Docker Image Proffered for Benchmarks**: A member pointed out that the exact **Docker image** used for benchmarks can be fetched, noting that **AMD** is not finicky with performance counters in Docker, and linked the [AMD Dockerfile](https://github.com/gpu-mode/discord-cluster-manager/blob/main/docker/amd-docker.Dockerfile).
   - It was noted that while the image is published, its location is unknown, and **HotAisle** being bare metal allows for easy building on the machine, with **Runpod** also mentioned as a viable option.
- **GEMM Submission Times Out!**: A user reported a timeout issue with the submission cluster for **GEMM**, even with the reference kernel.
   - It was suggested that the submission code be modified to allow multiprocess per same GPU for correctness, and to use **git** for syncing and **AMD Dev Cloud** for saving snapshots, but others pointed out submissions have been recent, and a cluster health issue may be responsible for the timeout.
- **Cluster Health Falters**: Members indicated a likely cluster health issue causing submission timeouts, with the team awaiting assistance from **AMD** to resolve it.
   - Despite the issue, a member expressed appreciation for the overall setup, frontend, and CLI, acknowledging the difficulty and time consumption of hosting a contest.

- **CUTE Shape Compatibility Deep Dive**: A member inquired about shape compatibility in the CUTE layout docs, specifically regarding `Shape (24)` and `Shape 24`, with another member clarifying that `shape 24` and `shape (24)` are conceptually the same, but the parentheses limit compatibility.
   - Compatibility is an *antisymmetric* notion: *`S compatible with T and T compatible with S implies S = T`*, with the term *`S refines T`* meaning T is compatible with S. For example, `(24)` refines `24` because `24 = size((24))`.
- **Indexing Shapes in CUTE**: A member asked if the shape compatibility requirements in the CUTE documentation meant that *all coordinates within A are valid coordinates within B*.
   - Another member confirmed that the valid coordinates of `(24)` are `(0), (1), (2)...`, while for `24` they are `0, 1, 2, 3...`, so integers can index into `(24)` but not vice versa.
- **Seeking CUTE Code for PTX Diagrams**: A member asked where the CUTE code for generating the PTX diagrams could be found, with another member providing possible leads.
