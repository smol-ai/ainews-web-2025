They also posted a link to [Runpod's "Stop Pod" documentation](https://docs.runpod.io/docs/stop-pod) and shared an example curl command, but noted that "stop" isn't the same as "terminate".
- **Configuring Runpod container to exit after task completion**:`@_jp1_` expressed a desire for a Runpod container to exit as soon as a self-contained training task was complete, as Runpod's default behavior appears to be to restart the container indefinitely. Because running the container can be costly, they were looking for a solution that wouldn't require an external server or service to monitor the job and stop the container. 
- **Suggestion for Automatically Stopping Runpod After Task Completion**: In response to `_jp1_`, `@caseus_` suggested setting up a callback at the end of training that would shut down the container once the task was complete. This could possibly involve a timer to make sure the final checkpoint is uploaded before shutdown.
- **Viewing Images Without a Base URL**: `@mustapha7150` asked how to view an image when the output did not contain a base URL. This question wasn't answered in the provided messages.

Only 1 channel had activity, so no need to summarize...

- **Discussion about Training and Quality of Sparsely Activated Models**: User `@someone13574` suggested that during training perhaps topk doesn't have a limit, or there might be a small amount of leak. Later, `@saunderez` theorized that the quality drop in sparsely activated models could be associated with most MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) activations being zero in a sparse model.
- **Running Code on Graphic Cards**: User `@goldkoron` stated that they used a combination of a 3090 and a 4060ti 16gb graphic cards, equating to 40gb for their tasks. When asked about the codebase by `@tcapelle`, `@goldkoron` replied that they use the Text Gen WebUI, exllamav2 with an experimental branch.
- **Accuracy of Language Models**: Users `@alliebot3000`, `@nyxkrage` and `@jiha` discussed the imperfect accuracy of language models. `@alliebot3000` mentioned how some models get extremely close but still miss the correct answer. `@jiha` pointed out that if a model isn't correct, it's simply wrong.
- **Suggestions for Improving Language Model Responses**: `@nyxkrage` proposed a potential improvement, suggesting that asking language models to only give a final answer at the end of their explanation might yield better results. `@someone13574` responded by stating this tests a different aspect, not whether the model can provide the correct response immediately.
