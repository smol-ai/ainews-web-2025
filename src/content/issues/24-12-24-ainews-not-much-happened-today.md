- **Explore PyTorch profiler visualizations**: It was suggested to use **Chrome Trace** for viewing visualizations from the PyTorch profiler, while avoiding alternatives like **DeepView**.
   - For memory usage, **memory snapshots** are recommended as the best method for debugging.
- **Debugging CUDA memory usage**: To debug CUDA memory usage, PyTorch allows users to create memory snapshots that capture allocation states and can be viewed interactively at [pytorch.org/memory_viz](https://pytorch.org/memory_viz).
   - The process involves enabling memory history and saving a pickled snapshot using `torch.cuda.memory._dump_snapshot()`.
- **Benchmarking GPU performance comparisons**: A discussion arose comparing the accuracy of **triton.testing.do_bench** and **torch.inductor.utils.print_performance**, particularly regarding the absence of **torch.cuda.synchronize** in the benchmark loop.
   - Clarifications indicated that the CUDA event measures kernel time, suggesting that kernel launches in the same stream execute sequentially.
- **Inquiring about JAX benchmarking equivalents**: One participant inquired about a **JAX** equivalent for GPU benchmarking to enable fair comparisons with PyTorch methods.
   - While there was uncertainty regarding JAX, it was suggested that **ncu** could be used for benchmarking a single kernel.
- **Kernel timing considerations in benchmarking**: Concerns were raised about whether to use **synchronize()** in hot loops while benchmarking a forward pass during training, given the kernel overhead.
   - It was mentioned that for a single kernel, timing discrepancies may not significantly impact results.
