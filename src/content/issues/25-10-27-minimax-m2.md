# AI Twitter Recap

**MiniMax M2 open-weights release: sparse MoE for coding/agents, strong evals, and architecture clarifications**

- **MiniMax M2 (open weights, MIT)**: MiniMax released M2, a sparse MoE model reported as ≈200–230B total with **10B active parameters**, positioned as “Agent & Code Native.” The model is temporarily free via API, priced at “8% of Claude Sonnet” and ~2x faster per MiniMax, and licensed **MIT**. It’s day-0 supported in **vLLM** and generally available on Hugging Face, ModelScope, OpenRouter, Baseten, Cline, and more. See announcement and availability: [@MiniMax__AI](https://twitter.com/MiniMax__AI/status/1982674798649160175), [@vllm_project](https://twitter.com/vllm_project/status/1982675383091916856), [@reach_vb](https://twitter.com/reach_vb/status/1982705125157126590), [@ArtificialAnlys](https://twitter.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/1982714153375854998), [@MiniMax__AI](https://twitter.com/MiniMax__AI/status/1982683091115323419), [@QuixiAI](https://twitter.com/QuixiAI/status/1982830032260321453), [@basetenco](https://twitter.com/basetenco/status/1982796366108672393), [@cline](https://twitter.com/cline/status/1982948478105088047), [@_akhaliq](https://twitter.com/_akhaliq/status/1982591245043240975).
- **Benchmarks and cost profile**: On the Artificial Analysis index, M2 hits the new “all-time high” for open weights and #5 overall; strengths include tool-use and instruction following (e.g., Tau2, IFBench), with potential underperformance vs. DeepSeek V3.2/Qwen3-235B on some generalist tasks. Reported API pricing of **$0.3/$1.2 per 1M input/output tokens**, but high verbosity (≈120M tokens used in their eval) can offset sticker price. Fits on 4×H100 in FP8. Details and per-benchmark scores: [@ArtificialAnlys](https://twitter.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/1982714153375854998), [@ArtificialAnlys](https://twitter.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/1982714164310315185).
- **Architecture notes (correcting speculation)**: Early readings inferred GPT-OSS-like FullAttn+SWA hybrid; an M2 engineer clarified the released model is **full attention**. SWA and “lightning/linear” variants were tried during pretrain but were dropped due to degraded multi-hop reasoning (they also tried attention-sink). Public configs/code indicate use of **QK-Norm**, **GQA**, partial RoPE (and variants), and MoE choices like no shared expert; community observed “sigmoid routing” and “MTP.” Threads and clarifications: [@Grad62304977](https://twitter.com/Grad62304977/status/1982630154452246577), [@eliebakouch](https://twitter.com/eliebakouch/status/1982660966648324504), [@yifan_zhang_](https://twitter.com/yifan_zhang_/status/1982667098963734602), [@zpysky1125](https://twitter.com/zpysky1125/status/1982715183102660664), [@eliebakouch](https://twitter.com/eliebakouch/status/1982669681887773053).
- **Ecosystem PRs and tooling**: Day-0 inference PRs landed in vLLM and sglang; more deploy paths emerging (anycoder demos, ModelScope, Baseten library). PRs and threads: [@vllm_project](https://twitter.com/vllm_project/status/1982675383091916856), [@eliebakouch](https://twitter.com/eliebakouch/status/1982656807102451723), [@eliebakouch](https://twitter.com/eliebakouch/status/1982658438829334695), [@_akhaliq](https://twitter.com/_akhaliq/status/1982937250095882580).

**Post-training and reasoning: on-policy distillation momentum, long-horizon stress-tests, and agent frameworks**

- **On-Policy Distillation (OPD) resurges**: A comprehensive writeup shows OPD—training the student on its own rollouts with teacher logprobs as dense supervisory signal—can match or beat RL for significantly less compute (claims of “1800 hours OPD vs 18,000 hours RL” in one setup) for math reasoning and internal chat assistants, with wins on AIME-style tasks and chat quality. The method reduces OOD shock vs. SFT-only and resembles DAGGER in spirit. Endorsements from DeepMind/Google researchers and TRL support underscore that Gemma 2/3 and Qwen3-Thinking use variants of this.

- **RL coding results nuance**: Multiple reports reiterate that RL often boosts pass@1 but not pass@{32,64,128,256} in code benchmarks—evidence of mode/entropy collapse—across PPO/GRPO/DAPO/REINFORCE++. Threads: [@nrehiew_](https://twitter.com/nrehiew_/status/1982640656737849410), [@nrehiew_](https://twitter.com/nrehiew_/status/1982640671363387890).
- **Long-horizon reasoning (R-HORIZON)**: New benchmark composes interdependent chains across math/code/agent tasks; state-of-the-art “thinking” models degrade sharply as horizon grows (e.g., DeepSeek-R1: 87.3% → 24.6% at 5 linked problems; R1-Qwen-7B: 93.6% → 0% at 16). RLVR+GRPO training on such chains improves AIME24 by +17.4 (n=2) and single-problem by +7.5. Data and train sets are on HF. Overview: [@gm8xx8](https://twitter.com/gm8xx8/status/1982608933563826270).
- **Recursive LMs and long context**: “Recursive LM” composes a root LM with an environment LM that accumulates evolving context/prompt traces; shows strong performance on the long-context OOLONG benchmark. Call for task ideas: [@ADarmouni](https://twitter.com/ADarmouni/status/1982595457781002288), [@lateinteraction](https://twitter.com/lateinteraction/status/1982605308322329019).

**Architectures and attention design: shifting away from linear attention, MoE insights, and context compression**

- **Linear/SWA vs. full attention trade-offs**: Multiple practitioners observed teams abandoning “naive linear attention” and SWA hybrids in favor of full attention after ablations showed reasoning regressions at scale—even when hybrids helped throughput/long-context earlier (cf. GPT-OSS, Minimax M1 ablations). Minimax confirms SWA experiments hurt multi-hop reasoning in M2. Threads: [@Grad62304977](https://twitter.com/Grad62304977/status/1982630154452246577), [@eliebakouch](https://twitter.com/eliebakouch/status/1982647963467030704), [@zpysky1125](https://twitter.com/zpysky1125/status/1982847594926911984).

# AI Reddit Recap

## /r/LocalLlama + /r/localLLM Recap

### 1. Open-Source Model Adoption in Silicon Valley

- [**Silicon Valley is migrating from expensive closed-source models to cheaper open-source alternatives**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1ohdl9q/silicon_valley_is_migrating_from_expensive/) (Activity: 786): **Chamath Palihapitiya announced that his team has transitioned many workloads to Kimi K2 due to its superior performance and cost-effectiveness compared to OpenAI and Anthropic. The Kimi K2 0905 model on Groq achieved a** `68.21%` **score in tool calling performance, which is notably low. The transition suggests a shift towards open-source models, potentially indicating a broader industry trend. The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/K2-Vendor-Verifier) provides further technical details on the Kimi K2 model.** There is skepticism about the actual performance benefits, with some suggesting that tasks could be handled by existing models like **LLaMA 70B**. Additionally, there is confusion over the mention of 'finetuning models for backpropagation,' which some interpret as merely changing prompts for agents.
    - Kimi K2 0905 on Groq achieved a `68.21%` score on tool calling performance, which is notably low. This suggests potential inefficiencies or limitations in the model's ability to effectively utilize external tools or APIs, which could be a critical factor for developers considering model integration in production environments. More details can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/K2-Vendor-Verifier).
    - There is a mention of continued use of Claude models for code generation, indicating that despite the shift towards open-source models, some organizations still rely on established closed-source models for specific tasks. This could be due to the perceived reliability or performance of these models in generating code, which might not yet be matched by open-source alternatives.
    - The comment about finetuning models for backpropagation seems to reflect a misunderstanding, as it suggests the speaker might be conflating finetuning with prompt engineering. Finetuning typically involves adjusting model weights, whereas prompt engineering involves crafting inputs to elicit desired outputs from a model without altering its underlying parameters.

Key improvements include workflow simplification, enhanced visual structure, and minor control enhancements. However, the method is currently limited to IL/Noob models and requires adaptations like ControlNet and IPAdapter for compatibility with SDXL. Known issues include color inconsistencies in small objects and pupils, and some instability in generation. The author requests feedback to further refine the workflow. [Link to workflow](https://civitai.com/models/2047895/sonsistency-characters-or-generate-characters-only-by-image-and-prompt-without-characters-lora-or-ilnoobai-edit).** A commenter is experimenting with training Lora using datasets generated by this workflow, indicating potential for further development and application. Another user inquires about VRAM requirements, suggesting interest in the technical specifications needed for implementation.
    - A user, Ancient-Future6335, is conducting experiments by training a LoRA model using datasets generated from the discussed workflow. This suggests an interest in enhancing model performance or capabilities by leveraging the workflow's output for further training, potentially improving character generation consistency or quality.
    - Provois and biscotte-nutella are inquiring about the specific models used in the workflow, particularly the 'clip-vision_vit-g.safetensors'. Biscotte-nutella initially tried a model from Hugging Face that didn't work and later found the correct model link, which is hosted on Hugging Face by WaterKnight. This highlights the importance of precise model references and links in workflows to ensure reproducibility and ease of use.
    - The discussion includes a request for VRAM requirements from phillabaule, indicating a concern for the computational resources needed to run the workflow. This is a common consideration in model training and deployment, as VRAM limitations can impact the feasibility of using certain models or workflows.
- [**Tried longer videos with WAN 2.2 Animate**](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1ohhg5h/tried_longer_videos_with_wan_22_animate/) (Activity: 544): **The post discusses an enhancement to the WAN 2.2 Animate workflow, specifically using Hearmeman's Animate v2. The user introduced an integer input and simple arithmetic to manage frame sequences and skip frames in the VHS upload video node. They extracted the last frame from each sequence to ensure seamless transitions in the WanAnimateToVideo node. The test involved generating 3-second clips, which took approximately** `180 seconds` **on a** `5090` **GPU via Runpod, with potential to extend to 5-7 seconds without additional artifacts.** A notable technical critique from the comments highlights that asymmetric facial expressions do not transfer well, with the generated face showing minimal movement.
    - Misha_Vozduh highlights a significant limitation in WAN 2.2 Animate, noting that asymmetric facial expressions such as winks and lip raises do not transfer well to the generated output. This suggests a potential area for improvement in the model's ability to capture and replicate nuanced facial movements, which is crucial for realistic animation.
    - Dependent_Fan5369 discusses a discrepancy in the output of WAN 2.2 Animate when using a reference image. They note that the result tends to shift towards a more realistic style, deviating from the original 3D game style of the reference image. This issue contrasts with another workflow using Tensor, which maintains the original style and even enhances the physics, indicating a possible advantage of Tensor in preserving stylistic fidelity and physical accuracy.

### 2. AI Citation Milestones

- [**AI godfather Yoshua Bengio is first living scientist ever to reach one million citations. Geoffrey Hinton will follow soon.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1ohbdjp/ai_godfather_yoshua_bengio_is_first_living/) (Activity: 485): **Yoshua Bengio, a prominent figure in the field of artificial intelligence, has become the first living scientist to achieve over one million citations on Google Scholar. This milestone underscores his significant impact on AI research, particularly in deep learning. The image shared is a tweet by Marcus Hutter, highlighting this achievement and noting that Geoffrey Hinton, another key AI researcher, is expected to reach this milestone soon. The tweet includes a screenshot of Bengio's Google Scholar profile, showcasing his citation metrics and affiliations.** Some comments express skepticism about the quality of citations, suggesting they may include non-peer-reviewed sources like arXiv papers. Another comment humorously references Jürgen Schmidhuber, another AI researcher, implying potential rivalry or competition in citation counts.
- [**Albania's Prime Minister announces his AI minister Diella is "pregnant" with 83 babies - each will be an assistant to an MP**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1ohbgxz/albanias_prime_minister_announces_his_ai_minister/) (Activity: 1733): **Albania's Prime Minister has announced a novel initiative involving an AI minister named Diella, who is metaphorically described as "pregnant" with** `83 AI assistants`**. Each of these AI entities is intended to serve as an assistant to a Member of Parliament (MP). This initiative represents a unique integration of AI into governmental operations, potentially setting a precedent for AI utilization in political administration. The announcement, while metaphorical, underscores the increasing role of AI in augmenting human roles in governance.** The comments reflect a mix of surprise and skepticism, with some users expressing disbelief at the announcement's phrasing and others humorously critiquing Albania's technological ambitions. The metaphorical language used in the announcement has sparked debate about the seriousness and implications of such AI initiatives in government.
    - CMDR_BitMedler raises a technical inquiry about the AI technology being used by Albania's Prime Minister. They question whether the AI assistants for MPs are simply utilizing existing models like ChatGPT or if there is a proprietary model developed specifically for this purpose. This highlights the importance of understanding the underlying technology and its capabilities in political applications.

### 3. Claude Code Usage and Fixes

- [**Claude Code usage limit hack**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1oh95lh/claude_code_usage_limit_hack/) (Activity: 701): **The post discusses a significant issue with Claude Code where 85% of its context window was consumed by reading** `node_modules`**, despite following best practices to block direct file reads. The problem was traced to Bash commands like** `grep -r` **and** `find .`**, which scanned the entire project tree, bypassing the** `Read()` **permission rules. The solution involved implementing a pre-execution hook using a simple Bash script to filter out commands targeting specific directories, effectively reducing token waste. The script checks for blocked directory patterns and prevents execution if a match is found, addressing the issue of separate permission systems in Claude Code.** Commenters noted that this issue might explain inconsistent usage-limit problems among users, with some experiencing high token consumption while others do not. There was also a discussion on whether adding `node_modules` to `.gitignore` could prevent this issue, though it was not confirmed as a solution.
    - ZorbaTHut highlights a potential inconsistency in usage limits, suggesting that some users experience issues due to how the system handles certain directories, possibly linked to whether directories like `node_modules` are included in operations.

## [MCP Contributors (Official)](https://discord.com/channels/1358869848138059966) Discord

- **MCP Registry: Mirror or Separate?**: Members debated whether the [MCP Registry](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/) and the [GitHub MCP Registry](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/how-to-find-install-and-manage-mcp-servers-with-the-github-mcp-registry/) are mirrored or disconnected, with GitHub planning future **MCP Registry** integration.
   - Publishing to the **MCP Registry** ensures future compatibility as GitHub and others will eventually pull from there, and developers can self-publish **MCP servers** directly to the **OSS MCP Community Registry**.
- **Deciphering Tool Title Placement in MCP**: A member questioned the difference between a tool's **title** at the root level versus as **annotations.title** in the MCP schema, citing the [Model Context Protocol specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/schema#toolannotations) as unclear.
   - Clarification is needed regarding the precise placement and interpretation of tool titles within the **MCP's** structure for enhanced tool integration and standardization.
- **Clarify Global Notification Spec**: Discussion clarified the spec's constraint on sending messages to one stream to avoid duplicate messages to the same client, not restricting notifications to a single client when multiple clients subscribe as explained in the [Model Context Protocol Specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports#multiple-connections).
   - The key concern is preventing clients from receiving the same message twice, emphasizing context when interpreting the specification's guidelines on message distribution across multiple connections.
- **Debate Utility of Multiple SSE Streams**: Participants discussed a client having a POST stream for tool calls and a GET stream for notifications, confirming the default setup and reinforcing that messages shouldn't be duplicated, per [GET stream rules](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol).
   - Only **list changes** and **subscribe notifications** should be sent globally on the GET SSE stream, while tool-related progress notifications belong on the POST stream tied to the request.
- **Expose Potential Bug in TypeScript SDK**: A member identified a potential bug in the [TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/blob/e74a358728991216391995e8daa5d0573614abc5/src/server/streamableHttp.ts#L727-L741) where change notifications might only be sent on the current stream, not all connected clients.
   - The investigation revealed that the server must iterate over all active servers and send the notification to each, because the SDK's "Server" class acts more like a session and requires external management of subscribers and transports.

> `CUDA fork behavior, GPU bandwidth modeling, Vectorized data types performance, NCU Profiler for memory throughput, Signed vs. unsigned loop indices in CUDA` 


- **CUDA Forking Anomaly Investigated**: A member explored unexpected behavior with `fork()` in CUDA, noting that while state variables are shared between parent and child processes, CUDA contexts may not be correctly copied, but minimal tests with `torch.cuda.device_count()` didn't reproduce the error.
   - It was suggested that `device_count` may be cached, masking the issue, as seen in [PyTorch's source code](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/602ace5eb4f08ebb9e04ccf13f137160b7d6e8aa/torch/cuda/__init__.py#L1027-L1050).
- **GPU Bandwidth Mysteries Unfold**: A discussion arose around GPU bandwidth modeling, particularly how bandwidth behaves when scaling from a single Streaming Multiprocessor (**SM**) to the entire GPU, using a vector addition example on a Hopper GPU.
   - It was observed that using **256 threads per block** with plain data types yielded the best bandwidth, and the use of vectorized data types was unexpectedly slower, prompting a deeper investigation into memory access patterns and compiler optimizations.
- **Vectorization Ventures Yield Unexpected Results**: Members scrutinized a vector addition kernel comparing scalar and `double2` implementations, noting that the vectorized version appeared slower due to potentially unnecessary memory copies.
   - Suggestions included avoiding manual vectorization and switching to unsigned int indices, but these attempts strangely resulted in slower code, highlighting the impact of compiler optimizations like loop unrolling and load arrangement, with one member linking to [NVIDIA's best practices guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/index.html#loop-counters-signed-vs-unsigned).
- **NCU Profiler Recommended for Accurate Memory Metrics**: To accurately measure memory throughput, it was suggested to use the NVIDIA **NCU profiler**, which can provide insights into generated PTX and SASS code, aiding in optimization.
   - Adjusting the `clearL2` setting was recommended to address negative bandwidth results, which can occur due to timing fluctuations when clearing the L2 cache.
- **CUDA Compilation Recipe Shared**: A member sought guidance on compiling a `.ptx` file and linking it with a `.cu` file, and was advised to use `nvcc` with the `-dryrun` flag to understand the compilation steps.
   - By first using `-keep` to retain intermediate files and then examining the output of `-dryrun`, one can modify the `.ptx` file and execute the remaining steps, such as compiling `.ptx` to `.cubin` with `ptxas`.

- **Budget GPUs Beckon Beginner Brains**: Members recommended [Vast.ai](https://vast.ai) for a bare metal feel as the cheapest cloud GPU provider, but noted that your data runs on random community servers.
   - For learning purposes it is acceptable and provides virtual machines which might offer more direct access to profiling tools.
- **RunPod Runs Reliably**: [RunPod.io](https://runpod.io) is similar to Vast.ai but more stable for quick experiments.
   - It may not offer Virtual Machines.
- **Lightning Launches Learning**: [Lightning.ai](https://lightning.ai) is great for fast experiments and even has a **free tier** with limits.
   - The best strategy would be combining the **free tier** from Lightning.ai with Vast.ai.
- **GPU Grind Gets Gnarly**: Compiling an entire application to run on a GPU would result in very slow performance, since GPUs are not optimized for non-parallel computations.
   - GPUs are fast because they are optimized for computation that can be done on multiple threads simultaneously.

> `JAX vs PyTorch2 for pedagogy, Graph acquisition mechanisms, Dual language problem with Python/C++, Mojo and LLVM intrinsics` 


- **JAX deemed better than PyTorch2 for teaching**: Transitioning from **hips/autograd to JAX** is considered better than **PyTorch1 to PyTorch2** for pedagogical purposes due to the complexity of **torchdynamo and aotautograd**.
   - It is pedagogically better to lean more deeply on the embeddedness of the **DSL** rather than rely closely on the semantics of the host language.
- **Graph acquisition mechanisms under consideration**: There is a decision to be made regarding the **graph acquisition mechanism**, choosing between **explicit tracing (JAX)** or **implicit tracing (Torch/XLA)** and how it will compose with **tinygrad UOp IR**.
   - The user is choosing between tracing at the host bytecode level with torchdynamo and lowering with aotautograd.
- **Dual Language Problem Complicates matters**: The complexity stems from the **dual language problem** involving **Python/C++** and reusing the **autograd in C++**, making it unsuitable for the SITP/picograd audience.
   - The member mentioned that the dual language problem increases complexity for new users.
- **Mojo and LLVM intrinsics get a shoutout**: A member recommended exploring **Mojo**, which utilizes **LLVM intrinsics** as its foundation, defining everything explicitly at the code level.
   - The TLDR for Mojo is to use LLVM intrinsics as your foundation, and have nothing else be a part of your language's compiler, not even the notion of thread index.

- **New users seek setup help**: A user asked for guidance on setting up and testing **Mojo** and was directed to the appropriate Discord channel, with a request to include a specific user for assistance.
   - The recommended channel is the <#1119100298456215572> channel.
- **Modular Prioritizes DC GPU Support**: **Tier 1 support** is for customers with **Mojo/MAX support contracts** using datacenter GPUs, as Modular can be held liable if it doesn't work quickly.
   - Consumer-grade hardware support is lower because companies like **Nvidia** and **AMD** may restrict operations on consumer cards, limiting Modular's ability to offer commercial support.
- **AMD Card Differences Stall Compatibility**: The reason all **AMD consumer cards** are tier 3 is because AMD has massive differences between DC and consumer cards, and as such they required alternative codepaths in many, many places.
   - The architectures required alternative codepaths in many, many places.
- **Apple Silicon's Impactful Changes**: Limited **Apple Silicon GPU support** stems from Apple's unique GPU design, which necessitated reverse-engineering their equivalent of PTX, breaking assumptions in **MAX** and **Mojo**.
   - One community member claims Apple took GPU design in a very, very different direction than most vendors (many would argue better).
- **Windows Compatibility Troubles**: **Windows** receives less support due to its non-Unix-like OS structure and unique GPU communication rules.
   - Furthermore, hardware vendors might not offer datacenter GPU support on Windows, preventing Modular from providing commercial support contracts.

> `GPU random module location, Property testing framework, LayoutTensor limitations, MLIR vs LLVM, Mojo's metaprogramming` 


- **Fast Random Module Misplaced?**: Members questioned why the faster random module is located in `gpu/random.mojo` since it doesn't depend on any GPU operations, with one noting that equivalent C `rand` calls are 7x faster.
   - The decision was made as the default `random` is **cryptographic by default** (something that most C implementations do not do) and also pointed out that they aren't safe for cryptography as mentioned in the [Parallel Random Numbers paper](https://www.thesalmons.org/john/random123/papers/random123sc11.pdf).
- **Property Testing Framework Incoming**: A member is working on adding a property-testing framework, basing the work off of python’s **Hypothesis**, haskell’s **Quickcheck**, and Rust’s **PropTest**.
   - They plan to add a way to have *values that break stuff a lot* as one of the things to generate things from, such as -1, 0, 1, DTYPE_MIN/MAX, and empty lists, and have already discovered many bugs, such as [this issue with `Span.reverse()`](https://github.com/modular/modular/issues/5508).
- **LayoutTensor Limits Tensor Network Library**: A member is building a tensor networks library and ran into limitations with **LayoutTensor**, which requires a static layout, preventing dynamic rank tensors.
   - They tried using the [`dynamic_layout`](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/kernels/layout/runtime_layout/RuntimeLayout/) alias, but **LayoutTensor** doesn't support runtime ranks, though it does allow runtime-determined dimension sizes, with some suggesting to fallback to `RuntimeLayout`.
- **MLIR Gaining Traction for Compiler Dev**: A discussion compared using **MLIR** versus **LLVM IR** for building language backends, with some noting that **MLIR** can lower to **LLVM** and is more interesting.
   - While inline **MLIR** has dragons, it's a good option for compiler development, and a [Clang frontend](https://github.com/llvm/clangir) is being built with **MLIR**, though it's not meant for codegen, and some companies are reportedly using **MLIR** to **Verilog**.
- **Metaprogramming Powers Impossible Optimizations**: The Modular team posted an article discussing Mojo's metaprogramming capabilities and potential for impossible optimizations, specifically how to specialize hardware details (cache line sizes, page sizes) at compile time.
   - The article is located here: [Impossible Optimization](https://verdagon.dev/blog/impossible-optimization) and it shows a great motivating example for why someone wanted something like a `MaybeComptime`.

- **API Apocalypse: Temperature and Top_P Vanish!**: Developers are lamenting the removal of `'temperature'` and `'top_p'` parameters from new model APIs, with **Anthropic** dropping combined use of **top_p** and **temperature** past version **3.7** and **GPT-5** removing all hyperparameter controls.
   - The [Claude documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/migrating-to-claude-4) notes the deprecation, while **GPT-4.1** and **4o** are reported to still support the parameters.
- **Reasoning Models Kill Hyperparameter Tuning**: The rise of reasoning models may be responsible for the changes, but the reasoning behind the parameter removal is speculated to be for developer ease of use, preventing probability bleeding, security concerns, or concerns about average developer performance.
   - One member joked that the changes are *"also to piss me off personally? lol 😅 now I have to write a bunch of code in my api handler to treat gpt 5 and anthropic special. precious babys.*"
- **3090 Pretraining Ponderings**: One member inquired about resources for pretraining on a **3090**, having experimented with the **Wiki dataset** and considering the scalability of their ideas.

> `Global Notifications, Multiple SSE Streams, TypeScript SDK Bug, Server vs Session Confusion` 


- **Clarify Global Notification Spec Ambiguity**: The discussion clarifies that the spec's constraint on sending messages to only one stream pertains to avoiding duplicate messages to the same client, not restricting notifications to a single client when multiple clients are subscribed to a resource, as explained in the [Model Context Protocol Specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports#multiple-connections).
   - The key concern is preventing clients from receiving the same message twice, emphasizing the importance of context when interpreting the specification's guidelines on message distribution across multiple connections.
- **Debate Utility of Multiple SSE Streams**: Participants discussed the scenario of a client having both a POST stream for tool calls and a GET stream for general notifications, confirming the default setup and reinforcing that messages should not be duplicated across both, according to [the rules for the GET stream](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol).
   - It was suggested that only **list changes** and **subscribe notifications** should be sent globally on the GET SSE stream, while tool-related progress notifications and results belong on the POST stream tied to the specific request.
- **Expose Potential Bug in TypeScript SDK**: A member identified a potential bug in the [TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/blob/e74a358728991216391995e8daa5d0573614abc5/src/server/streamableHttp.ts#L727-L741) where change notifications might only be sent on the current standalone stream, rather than to all connected clients.
   - The investigation revealed that the server needs to iterate over all active servers and send the notification to each one, as the SDK's "Server" class behaves more like a session, requiring external management of subscribers and transports.
- **Differentiate Server from Session Semantics**: The discussion highlighted the distinction between the TS SDK's "Server" class and a real-world server implementation, noting that the SDK's "Server" behaves more like a session.
   - Real servers, like those built with Express, require a **singleton state mechanism** to manage multiple connections and ensure all instances have access to the same data and subscriber information, referencing an [example server implementation](https://github.com/cliffhall/puzzlebox/blob/main/src/puzzlebox.ts#L121).

   - Another user suggested using **TinyJIT** for optimization, with [an example](https://x.com/__tinygrad__/status/1982634315520651498) and [gist](https://gist.github.com/geohot/cb8c6ea335dfed87a707618d7fff39af) to help guide their work.
- **Codebase Cleanup: pyright catches real bugs**: A member noted that **pyright** found real type issues in the codebase.
   - They suggest to merge tasteful fixes.
- **Meeting #93 Agenda**: Meeting #93 agenda includes **company update**, **new linearizer**, **SPEC**, **flash attention**, **openpilot regression**, **FUSE_OPTIM, assign?**, **viz**, **driver**, **tiny kitten**, **more symbolic?**, **other bounties, fp8, clang2py**.

> `tinygrad PRs, tinygrad Bounties, TinyJit performance, Kernel Fusion bug` 


- ****Newbie-Friendly PRs** Beckon!**: A member inquired about good **PRs** for someone starting with a few weeks of **tinygrad** experience.
   - Another member suggested checking out the [tinygrad bounties](https://bounties.tinygrad.org/), specifically the **$100-$200** ones.
- ****RTX 5090** Runs Slow!**: A member reported slow performance when running code with **12 512x512 images** on an **RTX 5090** using **TinyJit**.
   - The code used **X_val** as 12 **512x512** images and **Y_val** as 12 floating point numbers to compute and print the time it takes to execute `get_val_acc`.
- ****Kernel Fusion Bug** Causes Slowdown**: George Hotz identified a potential **bug in kernel fusion**, noting that a kernel taking **250 seconds** indicates an issue.
   - He suggested adding `.contiguous()` after the model to fix it quickly and encouraged the member to post a full repro in an issue; it was also mentioned that if a kernel takes over a second, it's probably broken.
- **Trimming Code for **Bug Reports****: A member trimmed down their code for a **bug report**, seeking feedback on whether the amount of fusion was still excessive.
   - The member also mentioned that the `.contiguous()` did work as expected.
