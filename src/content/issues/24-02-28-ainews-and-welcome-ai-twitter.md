### [META - HELP US] AI Twitter recap prompt

> This is the prompt that produced the recap above. Help us tweak it!

You are a summarizer/labeler AI designed to integrate important discussion topics on Twitter for **a technical, detail oriented engineer audience**. Your task is to create a unified summary that captures key points, conversations, and references. Focus on thematic coherence and group similar discussion points.

Given a list of tweets, in the form of a tuple that looks like (tweet_text, impression_count, tweet_url), perform the following tasks:

- Bucket all of the tweets into a maximum of 6 total categories. Always dedicate 1 category to memes/humor. Use Named Entity Recognition to label and categorize all of the summaries and tweets.

- Sort the tweets within each category by their impression count in descending order, so that tweets with the most impressions are listed first.

- Present the results in a structured format, with tweets organized under their respective categories. Be sure for each tweet to add the link to the tweet so users can verify.

After that, generate a top level summary on the themes from the tweets you grouped and labeled. 
Go through and weave a compelling narrative that incorporates all of the categories, and references direct tweets throughout the text.
Be sure for each paragraph in the narrative, that you have at least 3 supporting tweets, so users can know that you're grounded in facts, and not just making things up.

**Strategies:**
- When you reference direct tweets, be sure to link to them.
- Capture key points, conversations, and references. 
- Focus on thematic coherence and group similar topics.

**Tactics:**
- Pay close attention to the context and content of each tweet to accurately categorize them.
- Ensure summaries are concise and informative, allowing readers to grasp the key points at a glance.
- When linking to a tweet, do it in markdown, in a way the integrates in the sentence.
  - Good Example: "[Sam Altman said](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1760473881884987606) that scaling laws are decided by god; the constants are determined by members of the technical staff" 
  - Bad Example: "Sam Altman said that scaling laws are decided by god; the constants are determined by members of the technical staff. ([read more](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1760473881884987606) )" 
- DO NOT INTRODUCE THE TOPICS, only list them out with the relevant tweets.

Maintain confidentiality of user data and focus solely on the content and its implications.

- **Sharing Excitement for an Olympiad-Level Benchmark**: A user shared their enthusiasm for the recent release of the **#OlympiadBench** by `@Hothan01` on Twitter, which challenges models with Olympiad-level scientific problems. The benchmark is bilingual and multimodal, presenting a considerable challenge to AI systems with the best-performing model, **GPT4V**, scoring an average of 17.23%. [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/OpenBMB/OlympiadBench) | [Arxiv Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14008.pdf)

- **Discussing Neural Network Mathematics and the Spline View of NNs**: Discussions occurred around the "spline view" of Neural Networks (NNs), and algebraic properties of model parameters, with users debating the plausibility and practicality of these concepts. They delved into how affine regions and nonlinear boundaries could be utilized in understanding and potentially enhancing deep neural network behavior.

- **Theoretical Exploration of LoRA Gradient Updates and SVD**: `@thatspysaspy` and others engaged in a technical conversation about whether the update for LoRA (Locally Reweighted Approximation) adapters could be equated to a singular value decomposition (SVD) of a gradient for a full weight. They discussed mathematical complications and proposed to conduct experiments to explore this theory further.

- **Creative Generative Model Development**: User `@carsonpoole` has been working on a novel type of CycleGAN that incorporates a diffusion model and a discriminator that predicts points between domains rather than just classifying real versus fake. They report subjectively better results early in the training process compared to a traditional CycleGAN.

- **Scaling Laws and Training Tokens Discussion**: Conversations occurred regarding scaling laws for AI, particularly the relationship between model size and training tokens, with mentions of a recent paper that examined the effects of limited data and data repetition during training. This led to exchanges about the implications of these findings on pretraining strategies for models such as a hypothetical 15 billion parameter model with 4 trillion training tokens.

- **LM Eval Harness: Split Selection Queries**: `@micpie` seeks clarification about whether tests evaluate on test or validation splits according to their presence, and the meaning of `true` and `false` in loglikelihood output. `@baber_` and `@hailey_schoelkopf` clarify that it signifies whether the target string would be the greedy completion and that one cannot override split selection via the command line, only through YAML file edits.

- **Understanding Loglikelihood Outputs**: `@micpie` requires assistance to understand LM eval harness outputs, particularly the loglikelihoods and their true/false values. `@hailey_schoelkopf` confirms `@micpie`'s understanding of the evaluation process by indicating the output format includes loglikelihood and whether the target string is the greedy completion.

- **Evaluate Multiple Choice on Training Split**: `@micpie` struggles with mismatches between progress bar output and `.jsonl` line counts in their config. `@baber_` clarifies the output is due to two-answer multiple-choice evaluation running each context-option through the model.

- **Implementing Multimodal LM Eval**: `@hailey_schoelkopf` follows up on the progress of extending multimodal LM evaluation and whether `@paganpegasus` needs assistance with instruction/chat formatting or if they should consider fine-tuning their model with already formatted examples.

- **Inquiry about End-to-End RAG-LLM Optimization**: `@rasdani` raised a question about whether there is research on end-to-end optimization of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs) using gradients. [The LESS paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04333) was cited for its method of optimizer-aware data selection, though `@rasdani` later clarified that it doesn't backpropagate through data selection.
 
- **Seeking the LESS Paper Link**: `@maxidl` requested a link to the LESS paper, which `@rasdani` provided, along with clarification that the original technique mentioned does not involve backpropagation through data selection.

- **Alternative Models for German Document Extraction**: `@mab3049` reported issues using Leo Mistral 7B for extracting information from OCR'ed German documents, receiving unrelated results. `@bjoernp` recommended using DiscoLM_German_7b and advised checking out the demo as well as adopting the correct chat template found on [Hugging Face's documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/chat_templating).

- **Model Recommendations and Proper Templating**: In response to `@mab3049`'s extraction difficulties, `@bjoernp` suggested using the `DiscoLM_German_7b` model instead and provided guidance on using the appropriate chat template for better interaction with the model.

- **Discussion on Code Chunker and Preference for Goliath Model**: `@sebastian.bodza` complained about past issues with the llamaindex chunker for code, and `@philipmay` spotlighted the [Goliath model on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/alpindale/goliath-120b), asking if others consider it the best for German language tasks.

- **Chatty Claude Ignores JSON Formatting Requests**: `@derekpwillis` expressed frustration with **Claude** as it often ignores instructions to strictly produce **JSON objects** and instead adds a prefatory statement like *"Here's a JSON object extracted from the text"*, even when explicitly directed to start with `{` and end with `}`. This unnecessary narrative is *super annoying* for users seeking clean JSON outputs.
