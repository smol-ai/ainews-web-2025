### Nous Research AI Channel: [off-topic](https://discord.com/channels/1053877538025386074/1109649177689980928) (6 messages🔥): 

<strong>Discussion & Progress on Parquet Dataset Handling</strong>:

<ul>
    <li><strong>Improvements on Dataset Handling Process</strong>: @tsunemoto revealed an improved method for handling the dataset. He mentioned that retaining the dataset in parquet and storing all images as blobs, as well as integrating batch processing, significantly increased the process speed. He also developed a new script that allows exploring the blob'd parquet, including searching through it using regex and automatically converting the blobs back to images upon query.</li>

    <li><strong>Discussion Around Dataset Origin</strong>: @tsunemoto and @yorth_night mused about how the dataset was initially constructed, as Midjourney doesn't provide an API. They speculated it could have been created through an unofficial workaround or possibly a data leak.</li>

    <li><strong>Exploration of Future Possibilities</strong>: @yorth_night suggested that an LLM (Language Model) could potentially rephrase the prompts in the dataset to become more instructional, allowing for generation with natural language instead of merely tags. This idea was well-received by @tsunemoto, who noted it might aid in multimodal benchmarking.</li>

    <li><strong>Collaborative Work and Shared Resources</strong>: Both @tsunemoto and @yorth_night decided to share the workload, each taking a different section of the dataset to process. They also agreed to share scripts and resources to accomplish the task more efficiently. @yorth_night selected parquet file `00001` and @tsunemoto worked on `00002`.</li>

    <li><strong>Challenges and Proposed Solutions</strong>: @yorth_night reported that the resource-intense processing resulted in RAM crashes. @tsunemoto suggested possible solution such as writing the processed dataframes as they processed, rather than trying to concatenate them at the end. However, concerns were raised about potential data corruption if the process was interrupted mid-way.</li>

<strong>Summary of Hermes 2.5 vs Hermes 2 Performance Discussions</strong>:

<ul>
    <li> <strong>Model Merging Strategies</strong>: @alpindale explained the process of merging models like the Goliath-120B. This involves taking slices from different layer ranges from each model and stacking them on top of each other. Alpindale also mentioned a plan to finetune 120B so the layer stitches "heal" so to speak. <a href="https://huggingface.co/alpindale/goliath-120b?text=Hey+my+name+is+Julien%21+How+are+you%3F#merge-process">More details here</a>.</li>
    <li> <strong>Guidance-ai/guidance Updates </strong>: @mihai4256 reported a major redesign of guidance-ai/guidance, noting it now accepts GGUFs (llama.cpp). <a href="https://github.com/guidance-ai/guidance">Visit GitHub Page</a>.</li>
    <li> <strong>OpenRouter Price Drops</strong>: @alexatallah announced price drops for Nous Hermes and OpenHermes APIs over at OpenRouter. <a href="https://discord.gg/ntQdxTCKG3">See Discord Invitation</a>.</li>
    <li> <strong>OpenHermes 2.5 Beta Performance</strong>: @fullstack6209 reported 1.5-2.5 tokens per second performance on a $60 chromebook with OpenHermes 2.5 Beta using TheBloke's gguf.</li>
    <li> <strong>Issues with Inferring Capybara 34B</strong>: A discussion led by @yorth_night occurred about difficulties inferring the Yi Capybara model. @teknium provided advise about loading the model with LlamaModelForCausal and also provided a sample code for inference with HF Transformers.</li>

<strong>Discussion Summary of AI Models and Fine-tuning</strong>:

<ul>
    <li><strong>Merging Qlora with PEFT</strong>: @yorth_night suggested a method for merging Qlora using PEFT, and shared a Github link <a href="https://github.com/geronimi73/qlora-minimal/blob/main/merge_qlora.py">here</a>. @lightninglemons expressed interest in trying out this method.</li>
    <li><strong>OpenHermes and Fast Inference</strong>: @ac1dbyte queried if OpenHermes allows fast inference with vllm, to which @teknium confirmed it should.</li>
    <li><strong>Speed Issue with AWQ Model</strong>: @gabriel_syme reported an issue about AWQ model in vllm, which became twice as slow compared to the original model. He speculated it might be due to something with max_seq_len.</li>
    <li><strong>Sequence Lengths for Chatbots</strong>: In continuation to AWQ model's performance issue, @teknium remarked that chatbots usually would not be intelligible past a 4-8k context, or around a max of 32k if Mistral has been trained on it.</li>
    <li><strong>Fine-tuning for Structured Output</strong>: @ac1dbyte raised a requirement for his fine-tuned OpenHermes to produce outputs as a (semi-)structured JSON object for post-processing purposes. @teknium suggested starting with prompting before venturing into fine-tuning, and asked @ac1dbyte for specific input-output examples.</li>
    <li><strong>Function Calling for Structured Output</strong>: @tsunemoto provided a different perspective, suggesting that function calling might also achieve @ac1dbyte's requirements if the model supports it. A JSON grammar builder that's llama.cpp compatible was shared <a href="https://grammar.intrinsiclabs.ai/">here</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Fine-tuning for Low-Resourced Languages</strong>: @4biddden inquired if fine-tuning a model on a low-resourced language dataset would enable the model to speak that language. @crainmaker and @giftedgummybee noted that continued pretraining might be needed, and it would also depend on the complexity of the language and the information in the dataset. @4biddden later shared a Reddit link <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/14chx6o/finetuning_a_llm_on_another_language/jphlo4i?">here</a> to support the discussion.</li>
