> AI News for 8/5/2024-8/6/2024. We checked 7 subreddits, [**384** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **28** Discords (**249** channels, and **2423** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **247 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

It's new frontier model day again! ([Blog](https://openai.com/index/introducing-structured-outputs-in-the-api/), [Simonw writeup](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Aug/6/openai-structured-outputs/)) 

As we did for [4o-mini](https://buttondown.email/ainews/archive/ainews-mini-nemo-turbo-lite-smol-models-go-brrr/), there are **2 issues of the newsletter** today run with the exact same prompts - you are reading the one with all channel summaries generated by `gpt-4o-2024-08-06`, the newest 4o model released today with [16k context (4x longer but still less than the alpha Long Output model) and 33-50% lower pricing than 4o-May](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41173964). 

We happen to run AINews with structured output via the Instructor library anyway (doing "chain of thought summaries"), so swapping it out saved us some lines of code and more importantly saved some money in retries (since OpenAI does constrained grammar sampling, you no longer spend any retry money/time on poorly formed json)

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/1bb029d7-5bf2-4b98-84b9-4b14a067c8bb.png?w=960&fit=max) 

Based on our summary vibe check and prompts, the new model seems strictly better than 4o-May (example picked here, but you can see the two emails you got today for yourself): 

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/d17daacd-8da0-4f24-824b-921e558af59e.png?w=960&fit=max) 

and mostly better than 4o-mini (which we last concluded was about equivalent to but way cheaper than 4o-May):

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/a73c68c4-4261-4662-a007-6a50c8531f41.png?w=960&fit=max) 

New Structured Output API aside, which applies to all models, we think the unexpected 4o model bump is a good thing - 4o August is effectively GPT 4.6 or 4.7 depending how you are counting. We don't have any publicly reported ELO or benchmark metrics on this model yet, but we are willing to bet that this one will be a sleeper hit - perhaps even a sneaky launch of Q*/Strawberry?

- **Galileo's Hallucination Index stirs debate**: The release of [Galileo's Hallucination Index](https://www.rungalileo.io/hallucinationindex) sparked discussions about the criteria used to classify LLMs as open or closed source, particularly focusing on whether Command R Plus is classified accurately.
  - Users questioned if Command R Plus were indeed open source, with some advocating for a clearer distinction between **open weights** and completely open-source models.
- **Contentious licensing of Command R Plus**: Galileo's response clarified that they classified a model as open source only if it supports commercial use, pointing to Command R Plus's Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial 4.0 license as a limiting factor.
  - Debate ensued over the appropriateness of this definition, with members suggesting a new category for **'open weights'**, distinct from open source.
- **Mistral open weights: least restrictive?**: Contrary to the general consensus about AI models being labeled as open weights, a member pointed out that **Mistral's models** are available under Apache 2.0, a more permissive license offering greater freedom.
  - Efforts to confirm this included sharing links to [Mistral's official documentation](https://docs.mistral.ai/getting-started/open_weight_models/), showcasing their transparency with both pre-trained and instruction-tuned models.
