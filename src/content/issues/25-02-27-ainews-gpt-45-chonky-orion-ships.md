> AI News for 2/26/2025-2/27/2025. We checked 7 subreddits, [**433** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **29** Discords (**221** channels, and **8236** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **795 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

As [leaked yesterday](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-lots-of-small-launches/) and in an early [system card](https://cdn.openai.com/gpt-4-5-system-card.pdf), in [a (rather underwhelming? but still nice to see) livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfRYp0nItZ8&t=33s), **GPT 4.5 is finally here** (as a "research preview" still).

At 15-30x the cost of 4o and much slower, we know its a bigger model, but not much else. Because of the understood benefits of inference-time scaling, the benchmarks will generally [underperform the o-series models](https://x.com/arcprize/status/1895206472004591637), but outperform gpt4 and 4o:

With nothing else interesting in benchmark land, the community is back to exploring "big model smell":

- [creative writing samples](https://x.com/benhylak/status/1895212181597397493?s=46)
- [better responses to intent?](https://x.com/aidan_mclau/status/1895207802018341294?s=46)
- [better world knowledge](https://x.com/aidan_mclau/status/1895204587608645691?s=46)

What's very likely is that GPT-4.5 will serve as the basis for distillation or upscaling to GPT5, which is the confirmed future of OpenAI.

- **Efficiency Gains by Merging Weights**: The rationale emerged that decoupling **ROPE** for MLA could optimize computations by transforming **weight matrices** efficiently, thus simplifying the operations to two smaller matrix multiplications.
   - In contrast, merging weights for MHA may not provide significant advantages as it lacks the drastic dimensional changes that MLA entails.

> `GROUP OptOps performance, Arange test issues, BEAM search adjustments, LLVMLite speed concerns, Kernel optimization strategies` 


- **GROUP OptOps matching PyTorch speeds**: After rebasing onto master, the PR now successfully matches PyTorch speeds for the summing operation, achieving yellow status on tests.
   - This progress followed an earlier inquiry about optimizing the arange GROUP tests, which still remains open for discussion.
- **Processing slowdown with BEAM search**: The addition of GROUP and GROUPTOP options has potentially slowed down BEAM search due to an increase in the number of kernels to test.
   - Efforts are underway to identify and remove some OptOp parameters and exclude certain GROUP OptOps preemptively to improve search speed.
- **Feedback and review process outlined**: George Hotz mentioned that reviews would not be conducted until tests are passing and emphasized the importance of fixing failing tests.
   - He noted that performance on LLVM had decreased with no observable gain, reinforcing the need for effective solutions.
- **Seeking context on arange tests**: Vitalsoftware asked for any known issues regarding failures in arange tests related to GROUP OptOps, seeking context before diving in.
   - There was some uncertainty about whether this issue fell within the scope of the current work, but Vitalsoftware expressed willingness to address it regardless.
- **Local repro of timing issues**: Vitalsoftware is currently reproducing locally to compare the branch against master, attempting to identify any performance hindrances.
   - He is keeping an eye on potential inefficiencies from the newly added GROUP OptOps and considering solutions to mitigate test timeouts.
