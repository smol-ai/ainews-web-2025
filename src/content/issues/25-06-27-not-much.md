- [**Hunyuan-A13B released**](https://huggingface.co/tencent/Hunyuan-A13B-Instruct) ([Score: 480, Comments: 131](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1llndut/hunyuana13b_released/)): **Tencent's [Hunyuan-A13B](https://huggingface.co/tencent/Hunyuan-A13B-Instruct) is a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLM with** `80B` **total parameters but only** `13B` **active per inference, delivering benchmark results on par with much larger models (e.g., Llama 3 70B) while offering** `~5x` **higher throughput. Key features include a native** `256K` **context window, Grouped Query Attention (GQA), multiple quantization options, and 'hybrid reasoning' modes enabling fast or analytical inference; model is optimized for agent-type tasks (high scores on BFCL-v3, τ-Bench) and is readily deployable via HF Transformers, TensorRT-LLM, vLLM, and SGLang, with full code and Docker artifacts available.** Expert comments highlight the model's strong performance-to-memory tradeoff, noting it 'trades blows with DeepSeek R1-0120' and offers a 'perfect sweet spot' between power and VRAM use thanks to MoE. There's consensus that Hunyuan-A13B sets a new reference for local AI, with several commenters suggesting it embodies the direction Llama 4 should take.
    - Commenters highlight Hunyuan-A13B's architecture as a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with a total of 80B parameters but only 13B active at inference, allowing it to maintain `5x throughput` compared to models like Llama 3 70B, yet with similar memory requirements. This is attributed to the efficiency of MoE routing.
    - The model is praised for its balance between computational power and VRAM requirements: at the 13B active parameter size, it is well-suited for systems with 64GB RAM and is regarded as hitting a sweet spot, especially with its native support for a `256k context window`.
    - A licensing detail is noted: the model permits commercial use for up to 100 million users per month but restricts usage in the UK, EU, and South Korea, which has implications for global deployment in enterprise settings.
- [**Open source model that does photoshop-grade edits without affecting the rest of the pic: OmniGen 2**](https://i.redd.it/ypm4lnr4ni9f1.jpeg) ([Score: 390, Comments: 21](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lm1v2c/open_source_model_that_does_photoshopgrade_edits/)): **The image showcases OmniGen2, an open-source generative model designed to perform high-quality, localized image edits ('Photoshop-grade') such as color or expression changes, while preserving the rest of the image—demonstrated by changing a dress color and adding a smile. [OmniGen2](https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/OmniGen2) is notable for its Apache license, supporting broad usability, though some users have reported results not matching the polished examples, particularly via third-party interfaces like ComfyUI.** Commenters note that while OmniGen2 is not at the level of recently released Flux Kontext weights, its open, permissive licensing is significant. Some users also express disappointment with real-world outputs compared to samples, highlighting potential differences in deployment quality or implementation (e.g., via ComfyUI).
    - There is discussion comparing OmniGen 2 to the recently released Flux Kontext weights, with users noting that OmniGen 2 is *"not flux kontext level"* in terms of performance or quality. However, OmniGen 2's Apache license is highlighted as a key advantage, lowering usage barriers for both research and commercial projects, especially given the high costs associated with training such models.
    - One user reports that their own tests using the ComfyUI implementation yielded results that did not match the impressive quality shown in official OmniGen 2 examples, suggesting there may be a gap between demo performance and typical end-user output, possibly due to implementation details or further required fine-tuning.
    - There is an open question about the feasibility or existing efforts of training models to directly use or simulate actual Photoshop tools, pointing to potential research or future development directions for image editing AI.

- [**FYI to everyone: RTX 3090 prices crashed and are back to baseline. You can finally get $600something 3090s again in the USA.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1llms46/fyi_to_everyone_rtx_3090_prices_crashed_and_are/) ([Score: 156, Comments: 85](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1llms46/fyi_to_everyone_rtx_3090_prices_crashed_and_are/)): **RTX 3090 GPU prices in the US have recently returned to baseline (**`$650-$750`**), after a period of being above** `$1000` **over the past three months. The original post suggests potential volatility due to factors like the impending expiration of Trump's tariff extensions. Technical comments touch on large-scale multi-GPU setups (user owns 9 cards), consistent stress testing methodology (Furmark and Heaven benchmarking tools recommended), and the importance of checking not just product price but specific model specs (noted variance in power connectors and cooling slot design on eBay-purchased cards). Provided data reflects fluctuations in both retail and auction markets, and reinforces the need to verify model variant/detailed specs in secondary markets.** Commentary debates the extent and consistency of price reductions across purchasing platforms, and highlights standardization preferences (e.g., sourcing only EVGA cards for consistency), as well as the continued importance of thermal management (junction and VRAM temperatures) in multi-GPU environments.
    - One user advises buyers to run stress tests such as FurMark and Unigine Heaven after purchasing used RTX 3090s, specifically noting the importance of checking both junction and VRAM temperatures, which are critical for GPU longevity and stability—especially as used cards might have thermal degradation or hidden issues.
    - Another commenter highlights variations in the RTX 3090 models found on eBay: a 2-slot variant with only 2x 8-pin power connectors, which was not clearly identified in the auction listing. This shows the importance of verifying specific card details (slot size, power requirements) in secondary markets, as these can affect compatibility and potential use for multi-GPU setups or professional workloads.
    - There is also explicit mention that, while RTX 3090 prices have dropped significantly (to the $600-$760 range), RTX 4090s remain expensive, indicating that only last-generation GPUs have normalized pricing, while current-gen cards are still at a premium. This has implications for those balancing price-to-performance when building or upgrading systems.

Ensemble approaches, which aggregate multiple strong model translations, slightly outperform single-model outputs, validating hybrid use but not critique or reflection. The findings challenge the utility of 'thinking' steps for translation tasks and are detailed in this [blog post](https://nuenki.app/blog/the_more_llms_think_the_worse_they_translate).** Commenters speculate whether models capable of mixing languages during reasoning (like R1 zero) might differ, and specific model versions (e.g., v3 0324 or Qwen3 without chain-of-thought) are discussed as producing superior results when translation is direct and 'think'-free. The analogy to human overthinking is briefly invoked but not technically central.
    - A commenter points out that models like R1 Zero, capable of mixing languages in their chain of thought, might behave differently regarding translation quality when reasoning is added, suggesting possible architecture/model-specific variance in translation performance.
    - Direct comparisons between models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Experimental, Claude, R1, Mistral Le Chat, GPT-4o) show that Gemini 2.5 excels at contextually-aware translations, particularly for documents with domain-specific terminology. Gemini 2.5's success appears tied to its ability to select translations word-by-word during a pre-response reasoning phase, though it struggles with longer texts exceeding email length.
    - Another commenter references arXiv:2410.21333, arguing that the observed issues may be due to evaluating non-reasoning models on reasoning tasks. They propose that translation quality could benefit from explicit reasoning chains (self-critique and stepwise deliberation), given this property is more prominent in models designed for such pre-response reasoning.

No published technical data, timeline, or supporting benchmarks for such a generalized neural teleoperation framework between human brains and advanced humanoid robots currently exists in the AI, robotics, or neurotechnology literature. The original video content linked is inaccessible due to a 403 error.** Top technical comments express skepticism about the feasibility and timeline of such claims, referencing ongoing fundamental engineering challenges (e.g., 'audio-video sync problem') and a lack of substantiated progress in neuroprosthetic telepresence, with some suggesting these statements are speculative or for publicity rather than based in demonstrable research.
    - There is skepticism about Musk's claims from a technical feasibility perspective, particularly in terms of the challenges of real-time, low-latency neural interface systems capable of full-body control and sensory feedback. Currently, even achieving reliable, simple input/output (e.g., cursor movement, basic motor tasks) with brain-machine interfaces is at the research and prototype stage, with significant issues in bandwidth, signal fidelity, and practical deployment.
    - A comment alludes to persistent fundamental problems in technology—such as the audio-video sync issue—that remain unsolved, implying that more complex, high-bandwidth, real-time bi-directional neural interfaces needed for controlling humanoid robots remotely are unlikely to be solved in the near future. This reference highlights the gap between ambitious vision statements and actual technological readiness.

### 2. FLUX & Kontext Features, Use Cases, and Licensing Updates

- [**FLUX DEV License Clarification Confirmed: Commercial Use of FLUX Outputs IS Allowed!**](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1llywl4/flux_dev_license_clarification_confirmed/) ([Score: 243, Comments: 71](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1llywl4/flux_dev_license_clarification_confirmed/)): **The post clarifies that the FLUX.1 [dev] Non-Commercial License explicitly allows commercial use of model outputs (e.g., generated images), as per Section 2(d): "You may use Output for any purpose (including for commercial purposes), except as expressly prohibited herein." However, commercial use of the model itself (including hosting, inference in production, revenue-generating deployments, or use in internal business) remains prohibited without a paid license. Outputs cannot be used to train/finetune competing models. See the [official clarification](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Kontext-dev/discussions/6) from Black Forest Labs, and note that license terms state outputs must not be used for illegal, abusive, or privacy-violating purposes, nor avoid legally required labeling.** Commenters generally agree that clarifying the distinction between commercializing outputs versus model/hosting uses is valuable. There is consensus that a hosted Flux web service requires a license, while individual commercial output generation (by the user) does not; technical users appreciate the responsive license adjustment from Black Forest Labs.
    - Several commenters analyze the distinction in the FLUX dev license between personal/commercial use of model outputs and model hosting, clarifying that direct creation and sale of outputs (e.g., commissions) does not require a paid license, but deploying FLUX in a public or commercial web service does. The nuance is that using Flux yourself for commercial outputs seems permissible, whereas any user-facing deployment requires a commercial license.
    - Others raise concerns that the license wording remains ambiguous and seemingly contradictory. Specifically, they reference both the legal license text (stating no ownership claim over outputs and allowing use for any purpose unless prohibited) and the help page, where it clearly prohibits commercial use of outputs without a commercial license. They highlight the section restricting use in 'any commercial production environment' to 'testing and evaluation,' creating confusion over what qualifies as allowed commercial output usage.
    - Commenters express frustration with the legal language in the license, criticizing its vagueness and pointing to excerpts that suggest any commercial activity, whether direct or indirect, would require obtaining a separate license from the company. They warn that the lack of a clear, direct statement leaves users exposed to risk if they interpret the license broadly without official legal clarification.
- [**Single Image to Lora model using Kontext**](https://v.redd.it/ryflrcjtdi9f1) ([Score: 197, Comments: 36](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1lm0iu0/single_image_to_lora_model_using_kontext/)): **A new ComfyUI workflow (see [GitHub repo](https://github.com/lovisdotio/workflow-comfyui-single-image-to-lora-flux)) automates the creation of a LoRA finetuned model from a single input image by generating** `20 prompts` **with Gemini AI, producing dataset variations with FLUX.1 Kontext, and training LoRA—all in a linear, automated process. This approach is intended for character and product modeling use-cases and requires minimal user intervention ("one click"). Key workflow optimizations using Get & Set Nodes with switch nodes can drastically simplify the compute pipeline, reducing workflow complexity by up to 90%.** Technical skepticism is raised regarding dataset size: generating variations from a single source image likely imposes significant information loss, limiting generalizability and raising concerns about output quality. The utility could be greater if it accepted more images and allowed prioritized region selection and iterative dataset improvements.
    - A practical workflow improvement is suggested using Get & Set Nodes combined with switch nodes in ComfyUI. This reduces the sampling compute block to a single reusable component, with dynamic string input/output, streamlining the image-to-LoRA pipeline and significantly simplifying workflow complexity (by up to 90%), which eases iterative adjustments.
    - One critique points out that training a LoRA from a single image is fundamentally lossy: *"You're taking a single photo and running it through a grinder then trying to put it back together."* The loss in detail at each pipeline stage is expected to be high, and training on single-sample data is not robust compared to approaches that use larger, varied datasets with automated captioning and dataset augmentation.
    - A technical limitation of the Kontext approach is highlighted: face angles extrapolated from a single front-facing image are "gross" approximations. As these approximations are encoded into the LoRA, any model trained this way will inherit the geometric inaccuracies, making it unsuited for applications needing precise facial pose or structure fidelity.
- [**Flux Kontext is the evolution of ControlNets**](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1llklmv) ([Score: 188, Comments: 51](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1llklmv/flux_kontext_is_the_evolution_of_controlnets/)): **The post claims that 'Flux Kontext' is the evolution of ControlNets, implying a new technique or model for controllable image generation, potentially improving upon or expanding the capabilities of the original ControlNet framework. No direct benchmark data, implementation details, or release notes are present due to the inaccessibility of the referenced external content (403 Forbidden).** Top technical comment asks about the model's capability for translating from realistic to 'artsy' styles (real → artsy), suggesting interest in bidirectional or more flexible style transformations, which are less common in current ControlNet implementations.
    - Some users mention that Flux Kontext's addition of elements can yield very fake or unrealistic results, comparable to the output quality of older models such as SD 1.5, indicating limitations in realistic image manipulation.
    - A technical point is made that, while not necessarily offering superior quality compared to longer workflows with CNET (ControlNet) or IPA, Kontext's convenience lies in its unified workflow that removes the need to describe context or manually switch between tools, streamlining integration even if outputs sometimes need post-processing.
    - It’s noted as important to keep ComfyUI updated when using Kontext, implying that compatibility or feature improvements are closely tied to the latest ComfyUI versions for better performance or stability.
- [**[PSA] Flux kontex- You can regional prompting by adding boxes and tell model what to do**](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1llst43) ([Score: 145, Comments: 55](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1llst43/psa_flux_kontex_you_can_regional_prompting_by/)): **The post discusses a feature in Flux Kontext allowing for regional prompting by drawing a colored box (e.g., green) over the image to localize edit instructions via text prompts, such as specifying 'add a Flap pocket with a super tiny albino mouse peeking out in the green box.' This constitutes spatial conditioning of generation or edit, similar to [regional prompts in image editing models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01880).** Users report inconsistency in model responsiveness to regional prompts, and one questions whether other shapes/colors (e.g., red circles) are equally valid, indicating ambiguity in the UI/model's spatial cue parsing.
    - Concerns are raised about performance efficiency: specifically, that the new 11GB model in Flux Kontex is being used for tasks (like inpainting) that were previously possible with much smaller 2GB models. This suggests a potential regression or lack of optimization in model scaling, as one commenter notes, *“we can use this 11GB model to do what we could with the 2GB one. inpainting!”* highlighting questions about resource requirements and model advancement.
    - An authoritative source confirms that regional prompting using boxes (as mentioned in the original post) is officially documented by the Flux/kontext team, providing a reference to the documentation: https://docs.bfl.ai/guides/prompting_guide_kontext_i2i#visual-cues. This ensures regions and visual cues are a prescribed feature rather than an unsupported or experimental technique.
- [**Flux Kontext Dev can not do N*FW**](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1llpsk1/flux_kontext_dev_can_not_do_nfw/) ([Score: 114, Comments: 129](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1llpsk1/flux_kontext_dev_can_not_do_nfw/)): **The OP reports that Flux Kontext Dev fails to process NSFW tasks such as uncensoring mosaics, removing clothes, or modifying images containing genitalia, suggesting strong NSFW content filtering. A commenter pointed out that this is an intentional limitation, referencing the detailed usage policy on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/), where the developers have enforced strict filters to prevent problematic outputs.** Commentary reinforces that NSFW restrictions are expected and by design, with some users observing censoring behavior even when not strictly required (e.g., modest clothing added to stylized nudes), prompting criticism of the stringency of the filters.
    - One commenter points out that the restriction on NSFW outputs is deliberate and aligned with the detailed usage policy outlined by Hugging Face, noting that explicit steps were taken by the developers to prevent Flux Kontext Dev from generating such content. This is indicative of intentional content filtering mechanisms likely enforced on the backend to ensure compliance with platform guidelines.
- [**Inpainting style edits from prompt ONLY with the fp8 quant of Kontext, this is mindblowing in how simple it is**](https://i.redd.it/7ev3qrorej9f1.png) ([Score: 101, Comments: 17](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1lm5kil/inpainting_style_edits_from_prompt_only_with_the/)): **The image showcases the capability of the Kontext model (specifically its fp8 quantized version) to perform precise inpainting-style edits conditioned solely by text prompts. The examples demonstrate modification of both text elements (changing 'BUMP!' to 'SEX!') and object details (altering the computer's realism) in an illustration, without affecting the rest of the scene—indicative of advanced, localized generative control. This highlights Kontext's potential for simple, targeted image edits directly via textual instructions, with high fidelity at a quantized precision (fp8), offering an efficient workflow for visual content manipulation.** Commenters express excitement over the potential for new types of memes and creative edits, noting this as a significant progression in image editing capabilities compared to previous advances predominantly focused on video.
    - A user inquired about the viability of running the FP8 quantized Kontext model for inpainting and style edits on a GPU with 12 GB VRAM (3080 Ti), expressing concern due to generally high VRAM requirements cited elsewhere. This highlights practical hardware constraints and interest in deploying high-performance quantized models on consumer GPUs.
    - Another user noted that the Q2 quantization, the smallest available precision for Kontext, works *wonderfully*, suggesting strong performance and usability even at extremely low bit-width settings. This indicates significant efficiency gains and potential for running advanced models on lower-spec hardware.

> `Unsloth inference for model testing, Llama 3 templates, Memory leak problems with SFT, Loading datasets error, Qwen3 Vision tuning` 


- **Unsloth Inference Validates Fine-Tuned Models**: Before uploading a fine-tuned model to Hugging Face, use **Unsloth inference** locally to check its behavior to [avoid wasting time](https://docs.unsloth.ai/get-started/unsloth-notebooks) converting to GGUF and uploading.
   - Experiment with the 3B model for faster training to verify your setup before moving to larger models like `unsloth/Llama-3.2-3B-bnb-4bit`.
- **Understanding Llama 3 Model Templates**: When training a **Llama 3 base model**, avoid using the official Llama 3 chat template due to incompatibilities; instead use [correct formatting structure](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/chat_templating) so the model understands instructions/inputs from users and how to respond.
   - This formatting helps external software differentiate between user input and assistant output.
- **Diagnosing VRAM Fluctuation During SFT**: GPU OOM errors during SFT, such as with the [Qwen3-14B notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/unslothai/notebooks/blob/main/nb/Qwen3_(14B)-Reasoning-Conversational.ipynb), are often due to varying VRAM usage rather than a memory leak.
   - To avoid this issue, reduce `per_device_train_batch_size=40` to appropriately scale [gradient accumulation and batch size](https://docs.unsloth.ai/get-started/fine-tuning-guide/lora-hyperparameters-guide#gradient-accumulation-and-batch-size-equivalency).
- **Troubleshooting Dataset Loading Errors**: An error encountered while loading datasets was resolved by upgrading **fsspec** and verifying the use of `unsloth_zoo` in the import statements.
   - A user found that adding `unsloth_zoo` fixed the loading issue with a custom dataset, especially after a recent update may have broken something.
- **Fine-Tuning Vision Layers in VQA Datasets**: Fine-tuning vision layers in a VQA dataset is beneficial even if the ground truth is only available for the text answer, as it enables [gradient calculation and weight updates](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModelForImageTextToText.forward) on all layers of the model.
   - Pretrained multimodal architectures, when fully fine-tuned (SFT), require the vision layers for optimal performance, as confirmed by the community.

> `Tensor Cores in CUDA, Memory Bandwidth Experiments, GPU Mode Submission, CUDA vs HIP` 


- ****CUDA** Tensor Cores: Assembly Required!**: While **CUDA** supports tensor cores, direct **C code compilation** to tensor core instructions (**WGMMA**, etc.) isn't possible; inline **PTX assembly** or libraries like **CUTLASS** are needed.
   - The only tensor core instructions exposed in the **CUDA API** are the **WMMA instruction**. But inline PTX is still recommended.
- **Memory Throughput Mystery: Bandwidth Anomaly Arises**: In memory bandwidth experiments using **cp_async**, throughput drops from **85%** to **70%** when the total memory request per stage (**y**) is *less* than the theoretical per-μs bandwidth (**x**).
   - It may be related to **Little's Law**, where the comparison should involve bandwidth times latency rather than just bytes in flight, or a result of tail efficiency dropping due to unequal priority.
- ****GPU Mode** Submission: A Semicolon Saga**: Users are eager for **GPU Mode** submission to be available, as the current **torch cpp_extension.inline compilation** process takes a minute just to find a missing semicolon.
   - The primary issue is that it's overly restrictive. The team suggested that in the practice round competitions people just *install nightlies directly in your script and you should be good to go.*
- ****CUDA** Only: **HIP** Support in Limbo**: **GPU Mode** currently only supports **CUDA kernels** via **nvrtc**, but a higher-level API is being developed to wrap the **ROCm** equivalent for potential **HIP** support in the future.

- **Torch Compile Causes Kernel Randomness**: A member reported encountering random issues when using **torch compile** with custom CUDA kernels in LLM inference, observing that compilation introduces randomness not present when the kernel is used alone.
   - They find that `nn.Linear(), MyLayer()` works, but `nn.Linear(),nn.Linear(),MyLayer()` gives random results after compilation.
- **Opcheck Helps Debug CUDA Kernels**: Another member suggested using **opcheck** to test the correctness of Torch, indicating that if the internal tests pass, the issue likely resides within the kernel rather than the Torch integration, linking to the [Testing Python Custom Operators documentation](https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/python_custom_ops.html#testing-python-custom-operators).
   - The original poster said *"The op_check shows no issues. I can run the op no problem."*
- **PyTorch Nightly Fixes Compilation Bug**: It was suggested to try a **PyTorch nightly build** due to a stride-related fix: torch.compile in <= 2.7 can change the strides of the input to your custom op.
   - In 2.7, add `input.contiguous()` calls inside the implementation of your custom op as a potential workaround.

   - The big **einsum** operation (batched matmul) won't use tensor cores in the naive ref implementation because tensors need to be contiguous w.r.t. sequence dimension, but it's in the channel dimension.
- **Winning MI300x Kernel to Use FP32 Tensor Cores**: The winning **MI300x kernel** will transpose to use its **FP32 tensor cores**, but on the Nvidia side that's not available.
   - The suggestion was made to use **FP16** for inputs/weights so both architectures are on the same playing field, and downcasting is possible given the high accepted tolerances.

- **FLE structure confirmed**: The LLM receives the equivalent of `print(get_entities)` as its observation along with the inventory, confirmed to be identical to the FLE structure the LLM gets.
   - One member suggested adding the result of `get_entities` into the formatter, but others think formatting is less important for the pre-training task as the template conveys no additional information.
- **LuaPlayer departure moves forward**: All tests for /actions and /entities are working in PR #223, other than the ones that have been fixed in main, and can be ran with the `RUN_WITHOUT_FACTORIO_CLIENT=true` flag, meaning LuaPlayer can go.
   - Members agreed that LuaPlayer prevents rendering and needs to be updated in the readme post the #223 merge and a minor version bump.
- **Rockets tests are unexpectedly failing**: The rockets test in /entities fails even on main with the error `assert EntityStatus.LAUNCHING_ROCKET == EntityStatus.ITEM_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE` indicating an issue with game state or test alignment.
   - After investigation the test issue has to do with the game.sleep durations not being entirely aligned with what would happen in game, as increasing it to 60 seconds still fails.
- **Gym environment tests run**: The gym environment is running, as evidenced by the [screenshot of the iron ore task](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1354169122107293786/1388146300335161393/Screenshot_2025-06-27_at_16.17.31.png?ex=6860943c&is=685f42bc&hm=a3795d2194a455664097c2358edb7786f2b51be645a6f73d2841de369c87ada3&).
   - Despite screenshots, some gym environment tests are failing due to a missing 'options' argument in `FactorioGymEnv.reset()`.
- **Factorio Draftsman API surfaces**: A member introduced [Factorio Draftsman](https://factorio-draftsman.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html), a universal solution to create and manipulate Factorio blueprint strings.

- **BERT Step Shaved Down by Scheduler Hacks**: A full **BERT** step has been optimized to **2s** using scheduler hacks, down from **15s**, but upstreaming these changes poses a challenge.
   - The current native time is **1200ms**, and to match it (**1500ms * 0.8 = 1200**) further optimizations are needed, including full link utilization, which is currently lacking.
- **Multi-QP RDMA to hide NIC latency**: The NIC's slow reading from GPU memory may be mitigated by overlapping transfers from multiple GPUs using **multi-queue pair (QP)** RDMA.
   - Despite concerns about added complexity, multi-QP may hide the NIC latency, though root-causing the issue is preferable unless there's a clear hardware limitation.
- **PCIe Topology causes GPU-NIC Bottleneck**: The speed of GPU-to-GPU transfers varies significantly based on the PCIe topology, with transfers involving the NIC being slower if they cross IO dies.
   - Specifically, a setup like *`GPU <-> IOD <-> NIC <-> SWITCH <-> NIC <-> IOD <-> GPU` is fast*, while *`GPU <-> IOD <-> IOD2 <-> NIC <-> SWITCH <-> NIC <-> IOD <-> IOD2 <-> GPU` is slow*, indicating a topology-related bottleneck.
- **RoCE MTU capped at 4K**: The MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) is limited to **4K** due to RoCE (RDMA over Converged Ethernet) limitations, which must maintain compatibility with both Ethernet and InfiniBand (IB).
   - While Ethernet can support higher MTUs like 9000, RoCE's compatibility constraints restrict it to a maximum of 4096, which might be impacting performance.

- **Jupyter Documentation Urgently Needed**: Members are requesting better documentation for using **Mojo with Jupyter**, reporting difficulties until finding a forum post workaround.
   - The current documentation lacks sufficient guidance on setting up **Jupyter kernels** for Mojo development.
- **Pixi Installation Frustrations**: A user encountered errors while attempting to install Mojo with **Pixi**, despite following the official documentation, using `brew install`.
   - The modular-cli was reported as abandoned, recommending **magic-cli**, while the official documentation uses pixi install.
- **Magic Fork Merged Upstream**: `magic` was a fork of **pixi** while stuff got upstreamed.
   - Since everything is upstream, there’s no reason to keep a fork around.
- **GPU Puzzle P17 Compilation Errors**: A user reported that **GPU puzzle P17** is likely broken, encountering a compilation error after replacing implementation code with the given solution.
   - The traceback indicates a `TypeError` due to a missing positional argument, `device`, in the `custom()` function.

> `LLVM intrinsics with packed result types, Graph compiler: Python vs Mojo, Performance cost: Mojo from Python vs standalone, Mojo crashes and bug reports, LayoutTensor saving/reading to file` 


- **Blocked on LLVM Intrinsics Issue**: A member is still blocked on an issue related to [calling LLVM intrinsics with packed result types](https://forum.modular.com/t/calling-llvm-intrinsics-with-packed-result-types/1708) and is seeking workarounds or support.
   - No specific solutions were provided in the context.
- **Graph Compiler Written in Python?**: The graph compiler is largely **C++**, with graph nodes defined in **Mojo**, but the graph structure description uses a **Python API** to interface with existing Python ML codebases, as detailed in [this forum post](https://forum.modular.com/t/mojo-max-bindings/1499/3?u=bradlarson).
   - A **Mojo interface** was prototyped but deprioritized; a future Mojo interface doesn't preclude working with the open-sourced Mojo API.
- **Pythonic Mojo Performance Penalty?**: Calling Mojo code from Python using **MAX** incurs a small, fixed overhead, after which the execution primarily involves Mojo and C++.
   - The overhead stems from aligning **Python's dynamism with Mojo's strict typing**, and while the Python JIT project may improve Python's performance for smaller tasks, Python's overhead shouldn't be an issue if Python is mostly used for setup.
- **Mojo Program Crashes, File Bug Report**: A member reported a **mojo crash** during program execution, triggered by an illegal instruction, and was advised to file a bug report on [GitHub](https://github.com/modular/modular/issues) with the crash backtrace and relevant source code.
   - The crash was accompanied by a stack dump and a suggestion that it might be related to a dictionary miscompilation bug, and was advised to use `OwnedPointer`.
- **Saving/Reading LayoutTensors from Binary**: A member inquired about efficiently loading a struct of multidimensional arrays (as **LayoutTensors**) from a binary file, as can be easily done in C with `memcpy`.
   - It was suggested that it's possible by breaking encapsulation, writing to the buffer pointer directly (since Mojo doesn't have public/private variables in quick-and-dirty scenarios), and using libc for binary IO.

   - Metrics are produced to determine padding percentages, like *num_padding*.
- ****Packing's Effect on Batch Size Unpacked****: Using packing leads to a more consistent number of tokens per batch, reducing variance compared to unpacked batches, as referenced [here](https://discord.com/channels/1236040539409879167/1236040539409879170/1387913026038001714).
   - The cross-entropy loss in SFT is normalized by tokens seen, so high variance is a bad thing.
- ****Chat Datasets Embrace Packing, No Gotchas Found****: Packing with `chat_dataset` shouldn't cause any issues, even in multi-turn chats, as stated in [this message](https://discord.com/channels/1236040539409879167/1236040539409879170/1387921489271828521).
   - Packing creates a per-sample position ID mask, and padding indices are masked.
- ****Position Masking Precision****: Packing will create a per sample position id mask.
   - There's nothing to worry about the attention, and for the loss it doesn’t matter, padding indices will be masked and each token log prob is computed independently of the sample, and position mask will be **0,1,2,3, 0,1,2, 0,1,2,3,4, etc**.

> `DSPy Versioning, DSPy Evals, VLLM settings, Append Prompt` 


- **DSPy Versioning Discrepancies Prompt Code Review**: A user asked about **Snowflake** support in **DSPy 3.0**, noting a guide for version **2.4**, and was advised to *look at the code and ignore the docs*.
- **DSPy's Standalone Evals**: A member inquired whether to use **DSPy's eval functionality** alone or with frameworks like **Langchain** or **Pydantic** for comprehensive reporting.
   - The user wants to eval against multiple **DSPy modules** for the same or different signatures and instructions, rolled up into a single report, which doesn't come out of the box with DSPy.
- **VLLM Needs Prompt to Cut Thinking**: A user asked about specific settings for using a **locally hosted model** with **VLLM** to work best with **DSPy**.
   - They also inquired about appending * /no_think* to every prompt sent to the model, seeking to disable reasoning in **VLLM**.
- **VLLM Reasoning Fix**: Users discussed disabling reasoning in **VLLM**, with one suggesting a direct setting in **VLLM**, but another indicated needing a prompt for that.
   - One user found a **llama.cpp** parameter **--reasoning-budget** to set to **0** to disable thinking and shared an [image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1161519469319946286/1388323128609869835/image.png?ex=6860902b&is=685f3eab&hm=24f395e724b20fade7bbf75b56c22adada83aba568e8aa921da76c31484db278) suggesting a potential solution, while another mentioned a **hard switch**.

> `LlamaParse with LlamaIndex, Context Window Limits for LLMs, Chunk + Map-Reduce Pattern` 


- **LlamaParse Basic Usage Case Troubleshot**: A member faced issues using **LlamaParse** with **LlamaIndex** to query a **PDF** document, where basic prompts failed to retrieve information, even though the data existed in the parsed document.
   - Another member suggested the question might not make sense for a query engine, as it might require the entire document context, and that directly putting the document in the **LLM** context could be more effective.
- **Context Window Limits Discussed**: The member asked about context limits when dealing with large documents or multiple documents.
   - It was suggested that a **chunk + map-reduce** pattern would be helpful, but also noted that many modern **LLMs** have large context windows that could easily handle multiple 15-page documents.
- **PDF Conversion to Text Recommended**: A member suggested converting **PDFs** to text before processing, noting that there are very few use cases for "real" **PDFs** unless you are doing multi-modal processing.
   - Converting the PDF to text beforehand is recommended.
