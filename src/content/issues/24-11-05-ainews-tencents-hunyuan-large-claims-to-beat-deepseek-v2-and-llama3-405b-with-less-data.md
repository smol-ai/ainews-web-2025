  **Tencent** released a notable >300B parameter MoE model pretrained on **7T
  tokens**, including **1.5T synthetic data** generated via **Evol-Instruct**.
  The model introduces novel techniques like "recycle routing" and
  expert-specific learning rates, alongside a compute-efficient scaling law for
  MoE active parameters. However, its custom license restricts use in the EU and
  by companies with over 100M MAU, and it avoids China-sensitive queries.
  Meanwhile, **Anthropic** launched **Claude 3.5 Haiku**, now available on
  multiple platforms, praised for intelligence and speed but criticized for a
  **10x price increase**. **Meta** opened **Llama AI** to the U.S. defense
  sector, and a **Llama Impact Hackathon** offers a **$15K prize** for projects
  using **Llama 3.1 & 3.2 Vision**. **LlamaIndex** released a React chat UI
  component with Tailwind CSS and LLM backend integrations. The **MLX LM** model
  advances text generation speed and efficiency with KV cache quantization.

We tend to apply a high bar for Chinese models, especially from previously-unknown teams. But Tencent  's release today ([huggingface](https://huggingface.co/tencent/Tencent-Hunyuan-Large),[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02265) here, [HN comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42054186)) is notable in its claims versus known SOTA open-weights models:

Remarkably for a >300B param model (MoE regardless), it is very data efficient, being pretrained on "only"  7T tokens (DeepseekV2 was 8T, Llama3 was 15T), with 1.5T of them being synthetic data generated via Evol-Instruct, which the Wizard-LM team did not miss:

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/1e368282-dfd4-46a1-a302-eab911d70597.png?w=960&fit=max)

The paper offers decent research detail on some novel approaches they explored, including "recycle routing":

and expert-specific LRs

The even investigate and offer a compute-efficient scaling law for MoE active params:

The story isn't wholly positive: the custom license forbids users in the EU and >100M MAU companies, and of course don't ask them [China-sensitive questions](https://x.com/teortaxesTex/status/1853753632237232476). Vibe checks aren't in yet (we don't find anyone hosting an easy public endpoint) but nobody is exactly shouting from the rooftops about it. Still it is a nice piece of research for this model class.

> - `Dependency resolution in views`
> - `Hailo reverse engineering`
> - `Kernel consistency in tinygrad`

- **Dependency resolution in views**: A user questioned whether the operation `x[0:1] += x[0:1]` has a dependency on `x[2:3] -= ones((2,))` or just `x[0:1] += ones((2,))` when considering true or false share rules.
  
  - This raises important technical considerations about how dependencies are tracked in operation sequences.
- **Dissecting graph dependencies**: Questions arose about whether certain views in bug reports showcase many dependent operations and what these dependencies lead to.
  
  - Understanding the edge relationships in these graphs could clarify operational dependencies.
- **Hailo reverse engineering kickoff**: One member announced the beginning of their **Hailo** reverse engineering efforts to create a new accelerator, specifically focusing on process efficiency.
  
  - They expressed concerns about the kernel compilation process, noting that it must compile **ONNX** and soon **Tinygrad** or **TensorFlow** to **Hailo** before execution.
- **Kernel consistency amid fusion**: A user is curious if kernels in **tinygrad** stay consistent across runs, especially when fused using `BEAM=2`.
  
  - They hope to avoid the overhead of repeatedly compiling the same kernel, stressing the need for effective cache management.
