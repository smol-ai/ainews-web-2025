> AI News for 8/1/2024-8/2/2024. We checked 7 subreddits, [**384** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **28** Discords (**249** channels, and **3233** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **317 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

We want to know if the same lawyers have been involved in advising:

- [Adept's $429m execuhire to Amazon](https://www.semafor.com/article/08/02/2024/investors-in-adept-ai-will-be-paid-back-after-amazon-hires-startups-top-talent)
- [Inflection's $650m execuhire to Microsoft](https://buttondown.email/ainews/archive/ainews-inflection-25-at-94-of-gpt4-and-pi-at-6m/)
- [Character.ai's $2.5b execuhire to Google](https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/02/character-ai-ceo-noam-shazeer-returns-to-google/) today

(we'll also note that [most of Stability's leadership is gone](https://buttondown.email/ainews/archive/ainews-shipping-and-dipping-inflection-stability/), though that does not count as an execuhire, since Robin has now set up [Black Forest Labs](https://buttondown.email/ainews/archive/ainews-rombach-et-al-flux1-prodevschnell-31m-seed/) and Emad with [Schelling](https://twitter.com/EMostaque/status/1799044420282826856).)

Character wasn't exactly struggling. Their SimilarWeb stats had overtaken their previous peak and [spokesperson said internal DAU numbers had 3x'ed yoy](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/a-chatbot-pioneer-mulls-deals-with-rivals-google-and-meta?rc=ytp67n).

 ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/24aaa55b-03d9-4051-a07e-e6d6da4ebe98.png?w=960&fit=max) 

We have [raved about their blogposts](https://buttondown.email/ainews/archive/ainews-shazeer-et-al-2024/) and just yesterday reported on [Prompt Poet](https://research.character.ai/prompt-design-at-character-ai/). Normally any company with that recent content momentum is doing well... but actions speak louder than words here.

As we discuss in [The Winds of AI Winter](https://www.latent.space/p/mar-jun-2024), the vibes are shifting, and although it isn't strictly technical in nature, they are too important to ignore. If Noam couldn't go all the way with Character, Mostafa with Inflection, David with Adept, what are the prospects for other foundation model labs? The [move to post-training](https://x.com/_xjdr/status/1819435049655455987) as focus is picking up.

When something walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, but doesn't want to be called a duck, we can probably peg it in the *Anatidae* family tree anyway. When the bigco takes the key tech, key executives, and pays back all the key investors... will the FTC consider it close enough to skirting the letter of an acquisition but defying the spirit of their jurisdiction?

- **Llama 3 Implementation Progress**: A user modified the `llm.c` Python script to support **Llama 3**, noticing that the first sample generation matched but became divergent during the second pass due to differing kernels used as they didn't implement KV cache yet.
   - They are planning to refactor the code to minimize branching and consolidate the forward pass of attention for a cleaner implementation.
- **KV Cache Issues Identified**: The implementer highlighted that discrepancies in output were due to the KV cache state logic being inactive, leading to numerical deviations in logits during the second pass.
   - The user confirmed that all initial tensors and logits were equivalent in earlier stages, suggesting that implementing KV cache could ensure identical sample generation.
- **Acquihires in AI Industry**: Discussion emerged around multiple companies such as Character AI and Inflection AI undergoing acquihires, signaling a trend in the industry where promising companies are being absorbed.
   - Concerns were raised regarding the potential impact on the ecosystem, suggesting that while more players may enhance competition, it also raises questions about the value of coding versus conceptual thinking in AI development.
- **Randomness in Tensor Operations**: It was noted that different tensor shapes in operations could lead to different kernels being invoked, resulting in varying numerical outputs.
   - This led to suggestions of passing in custom random number generators to ensure consistent behavior across tensor operations.
- **Comparative Performance of RDNA vs CDNA**: Performance discrepancies were observed between RDNA and CDNA setups, with the latter showing improved validation loss in a specific AI model despite different hardware architectures.
   - Users discussed that RDNA uses microcoded matrix operations through vector units, while CDNA features dedicated matrix hardware, potentially influencing performance results.

   - One expressed concern that using both patterns could lead to complexities that might *blow up in the programmer's face*.
- **Exception Handling Costs**: Concerns were raised about the expense of throwing and catching exceptions, with **darkmatter__** stating that pure Mojo libraries should avoid invoking such operations unless necessary.
   - He highlighted the challenge of implementing this effectively, especially on an **FPGA**, where it could massively increase resource consumption.
- **Quotes and References Shared**: ***yolo007*** shared a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iflu9zEJipQ) featuring **Chris Lattner** discussing the differences between *exceptions and errors* in programming languages.
   - The video sparked discussions comparing **Elixir's** handling of errors and how that might intersect with **Mojo**'s approach.
- **Erlang's 'Let it Crash' Philosophy**: The notion of **'Let it crash'** from **Erlang** was brought up as a possible design philosophy, where uncontrolled errors propagate to higher levels for handling.
   - It was noted that such philosophies might not align with **Mojo**'s aspirations, particularly in creating a robust distributed actor framework.
- **Flexibility in Error Handling**: Members noted that **Mojo** can utilize both exception and return error handling, allowing flexibility in catching errors through **try/catch** syntax.
   - ***yolo007*** mentioned a preference for wrapping code in try/catch structures to avoid explicitly managing all possible errors, indicating a leaner coding style.

- **Aider browser UI for code editing**: The new [Aider browser UI demo video](https://aider.chat/docs/usage/browser.html) showcases collaboration with LLMs to edit code in local git repos, automatically committing changes with sensible messages.
   - It supports GPT 3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo with Vision, and Claude 3 Opus, and can be launched using the `--browser` switch after installation.
- **Post-facto validation in LLM applications**: Research highlights that as LLMs expand, humans currently verify **LLM-generated outputs** before execution, facing challenges due to code comprehension difficulties. The concept of integrating an **undo** feature and establishing **damage confinement** is suggested to facilitate easier post-facto validation of LLM actions [more details here](https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu/blogs/10_gorilla_exec_engine.html).
   - The study argues that post-facto validation—verifying after output generation—is often more manageable than pre-facto validation.
