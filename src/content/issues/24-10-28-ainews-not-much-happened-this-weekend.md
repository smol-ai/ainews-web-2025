> - `Max Autotune vs Reduce Overhead`

- **Torch Compile slows down models with Triton layers**: A user noted that their simple MLP model with **Triton layers** runs much slower with `torch.compile`, specifically when using `reduce-overhead` mode due to the **extra copy** required for CUDA graphs.
  
  - They found using `max-autotune-no-cudagraphs` significantly improved performance.
- **Custom Operations hinder performance**: Another user observed that wrapping Triton kernels in `custom_op` negatively affects performance with **reduce-overhead** mode, while other operations like **tinygemm** perform well even when wrapped.
  
  - They noted that without `custom_op`, they faced limitations using `torch.compile` in version 2.4.1.
- **GEMM optimization varies by GPU architecture**: A user shared that **torch.compile** optimizes GEMM differently on GPUs based on their **SM count**, with performance improvements noted on SM **\> 80** devices compared to those **< 80**.
  
  - They referenced a related discussion about how this architectural decision impacts performance, particularly for the **NVIDIA A10G** with 72 SMs.
- **Manual CUDA Graphs boost performance**: One member revealed they resolved their Triton layer performance issues by switching to `max-autotune-no-cudagraphs` and incorporating **manual CUDA Graphs** for faster execution.
  
  - For instance, they achieved **186 tokens/sec** end-to-end decoding speed using **Llama2-7B** on the RTX 4090, surpassing the **173 tokens/sec** with `reduce-overhead`.
- **GEMM restrictions based on version**: Discussion arose regarding versioning in **PyTorch**, with users pointing out that previous versions limited GEMM optimization based on SM counts.
  
  - It's suggested that the behavior may have changed as early as version **2.3** or before.

### **Torchtune ▷ #**[**general**](https://discord.com/channels/1216353675241590815/1216353675744641096/1300164394809950219) (4 messages):

> - `Embedding Config Flags`
> - `LoRA Bug Fix`
> - `TransformerDecoder Changes`

- **Embedding and Norm Layer Configuration Proposal**: A member suggested exposing **two boolean flags** (`embedding_trainable=False` and `norms_trainable=False`) in the configs instead of a list of names, to prevent future configuration issues if layer names change.
  
  - The idea follows the logic that transitioning from boolean flags to a list is less disruptive than adapting countless configs, especially as **TransformerDecoder** may require more expressive changes for various model types.
- **LoRA Bug Fix Submitted**: A member submitted a fix for the **LoRA** bug through [pull request #1909](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtune/pull/1909), addressing issues with single device fine-tuning checkpoint saving and NaN loss when `use_dora=True`.
  
  - They expressed uncertainty about whether it was functional across all recipes, noting bugs for distributed setups and NaN results for single device use.
- **Discussion on Configuration Flexibility**: Another member weighed in on the configuration proposal, acknowledging the pros and cons of both the boolean flag and name options, suggesting a preference for flexibility.
  
  - This indicates a consensus on the importance of adaptability in configurations to meet future needs.

> - `Hyperparameter Optimization Recipe`
> - `Discussion on muP Utility`
> - `Priority Issues in Development`
> - `External Tools for Tuning`

- **Exploring Hyperparameter Optimization in Torchtune**: A GitHub [issue](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtune/issues/1752) discusses creating a recipe for hyperparameter optimization where users can provide a config along with datasets and parameters to sweep.
  
  - The suggestion emphasizes the need for common defaults in a grid format, although it is noted that *no one has explicitly requested it* yet.
- **Debating muP Usefulness for Fine-tuning**: Members expressed skepticism about the utility of **muP** for fine-tuning, with one mentioning it is largely mentioned in the context of pretraining.
  
  - *Concerns were raised* regarding prioritizing other issues like faster generation and early stopping over the implementation of muP.
- **Higher Priority Issues Discovered**: A member pointed out that there are many open issues that should take precedence, including faster reinforcement learning generation and better classification with LLM.
  
  - They specifically highlighted the challenge of managing **200 open issues** and suggested support for distributed shampoo as another priority.
- **Relying on Existing Tuning Tools**: Discussion shifted towards leveraging existing external solutions like **Wandb sweeps** and **Ray Tune** for hyperparameter tuning instead of incorporating a new script into Torchtune.
  
  - One participant expressed a preference to leave these functionalities out of the library, as the existing tools already provide suitable solutions.

 

**Link mentioned**: [recipe for hyperparameter sweep · Issue #1752 · pytorch/torchtune](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtune/issues/1752): Torchtune could provide a recipe to do HPO, where the user provides a config, the recipe, eval dataset, params to sweep and budget.

### **Gorilla LLM (Berkeley Function Calling) ▷ #**[**leaderboard**](https://discord.com/channels/1111172801899012102/1214705495974092810/1300560060182954134) (2 messages):

> - `Leaderboard multiple functionality`
> - `GitHub example clarification`

- **Clarification on 'Multiple' Functionality in Leaderboard**: A user inquired about what 'multiple' on the leaderboard refers to, questioning if it involves multiple queries, functions, or steps.
  
  - In response, it was noted that 'multiple' seems to indicate the capability to select the correct function from several options, though the evaluation of multi-step functionality remains unclear.
- **Reference to GitHub Example**: The bot provided a [GitHub link](https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla/blob/2101b11f6d03d9f323715d7d2012a955d7f4114e/berkeley-function-call-leaderboard/data/BFCL_v3_exec_multiple.json#L42C1-L42C2438) as a random example.
  
  - The GitHub page details the project 'Gorilla: Training and Evaluating LLMs for Function Calls', providing context for understanding the leaderboard functionality.
