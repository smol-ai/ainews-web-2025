It is multimodality day in AI research land as two notable multimodality papers were released: [Janus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13848) and [SpiRit-LM](https://speechbot.github.io/spiritlm/).

## DeepSeek Janus

Earlier work like Chameleon ([our coverage here](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-chameleon-metas-unreleased-gpt4o-like/)) and [Show-O](https://x.com/swyx/status/1827099985944703408) used a single vision encoder for both visual understanding (image input) and generation (image output). Deepseek separated them:

and found better results in comparable size image generation:

and image understanding:

Open question as to whether this approach maintains its advantage with scale, and if it is really all that important to include image generation in the same stack.

## Meta SpiRit-LM

Along with [SAM 2.1 and Layer Skip](https://ai.meta.com/blog/fair-news-segment-anything-2-1-meta-spirit-lm-layer-skip-salsa-lingua/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=organic_social&utm_content=thread&utm_campaign=fair), Meta's Friday drop included [SpiRit-LM](https://speechbot.github.io/spiritlm/), a (Spi)eech and W(Rit)ing model that also includes an "expressive" version generating pitch and style units.

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/04271f45-146a-4aac-82eb-2ef24788ee30.png?w=960&fit=max)

[The demo](https://speechbot.github.io/spiritlm/) has voice samples - not quite NotebookLM level, but you can see how this is a step above standard TTS.
