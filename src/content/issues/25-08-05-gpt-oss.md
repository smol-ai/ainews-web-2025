Initial third-party safety tests are being referenced, indicating ongoing scrutiny by the open-source community.
    - The open-weight models are released under the permissive Apache 2.0 license, allowing use without copyleft restrictions or patent risk, making them suitable for commercial deployment and extensive customization.
    - The models feature several technical innovations: configurable reasoning effort for latency/performance trade-offs, full access to chain-of-thought outputs (useful for debugging, though not for end users), fine-tuning support, and agentic capabilities like function calling, web browsing, Python execution, and structured output generation.
    - With native MXFP4 quantization on the MoE layer, gpt-oss-120b can run on a single H100 GPU and gpt-oss-20b can fit within 16GB VRAM, enabling deployment on more accessible hardware. Full benchmark results are available at https://preview.redd.it/0nbuy4ejj8hf1.jpeg?width=967&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5840e94490e805fe978ba8bc877904cd3b94fe0c
- [**openai/gpt-oss-120b · Hugging Face**](https://huggingface.co/openai/gpt-oss-120b) ([Score: 342, Comments: 87](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mieqcb/openaigptoss120b_hugging_face/)): **The release of openai/gpt-oss-120b on Hugging Face is notable for being an** `~117B` **parameter model under the permissive Apache 2.0 license. A comment highlights its dual-parameter/active parameter approach (**`117B` **total,** `5.1B` **active), which suggests either MoE (Mixture of Experts) or related sparse activation techniques to optimize compute. Benchmarking results are yet to be independently verified.** Commenters note the unusually permissive licensing (Apache 2.0) for a model of this size, and speculate that this release suggests OpenAI confidence in its upcoming GPT-5. Discussion centers on the technical implications of the parameter split and the broader implications for the LLM ecosystem.
    - The model is noted for being released under an Apache 2.0 license, which is less restrictive compared to other open-source AI licenses, making it more amenable for both commercial and research use.
    - There is technical interest in the quantized versions of the model, with users referencing that Unsloth is preparing quantizations (quants) for `gpt-oss-120b` and noting that Unsloth's quants are "less buggy and work better" compared to alternatives. Direct [links to Unsloth models](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/gpt-oss-120b-GGUF) are provided, as well as [ggml-org quantized uploads](https://huggingface.co/ggml-org/gpt-oss-120b-GGUF).
    - The model is reported to be heavily censored, which could impact its utility in applications requiring less restrictive response generation or broader output coverage.
- [**gpt-oss-120b is safetymaxxed (cw: explicit safety)**](https://i.redd.it/o893aealq8hf1.png) ([Score: 349, Comments: 122](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1migl0k/gptoss120b_is_safetymaxxed_cw_explicit_safety/)): **The image referenced in the post is a technical benchmark or evaluation graphic showing the safety alignment (likely refusal rates, toxicity, or related safety measures) of large language models such as gpt-oss-120b versus other models, including possible mention of Nemotron. The discussion focuses on explicit safety metrics, with one comment stating it's 'one of the very few benchmarks I actually take seriously,' suggesting that the image provides meaningful or high-signal comparison for model safety. Another comment links to a fuller version of the benchmark, underlining community interest in transparent quantitative safety assessments. The post highlights a growing technical expectation for rigorous safety evaluation in open-source large language models.** Commenters seem to value the benchmark's credibility and granularity, with some humor ('Nemotron cockmaxxing') but mainly focusing on the seriousness and trustworthiness of the presented safety data.
    - A user expresses concern that making a "safety-maxxed" open-source model like gpt-oss-120b widely available allows researchers and adversaries to white-box study the safety mechanisms, facilitating the development of jailbreaks and logic attacks. The technical implication is that robust adversarial testing on open models could translate into more effective violations (e.g., prompt injections) on closed models, as attackers refine their techniques on open benchmarks.
    - The thread references a benchmark or visual evaluation (image linked by user) that is considered credible among technical practitioners. This highlights a focus on empirical, publicly-auditable safety assessments rather than relying on developer claims or opaque safety scores.
- [**Llama.cpp: Add GPT-OSS**](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/15091) ([Score: 310, Comments: 60](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mic8kf/llamacpp_add_gptoss/)): **Llama.cpp has added support for GPT-OSS, OpenAI's new open-source model, enabling day-1 compatibility for inference and experimentation. Implementation details are sparse, but the update points to rapid ecosystem integration with llama.cpp's efficient C++ backend.** Commenters question whether OpenAI is actively involved with llama.cpp integration and express skepticism about the model's licensing (specifically concerns about a 'responsible use policy') and real-world performance compared to top open-weight models.
    - There is skepticism among commenters regarding the practical usability and performance of GPT-OSS, with comparisons to state-of-the-art open-weight models. One user questions whether this is a genuine open-source effort by OpenAI or a PR move, highlighting the community's expectation for open models to meaningfully compete with established alternatives.
    - Licensing concerns are raised, especially the fear of restrictive or changeable responsible use policies that might impact downstream adoption or freedom. The community's technical stakeholders are particularly sensitive to licenses that are not truly permissive or might impose future constraints.
    - A question is posed about the timeline for release, implying close monitoring of upstream integration and readiness in projects like llama.cpp—demonstrating the technical community's demand for immediate, easy access to new models for local experimentation and benchmarking.
- [**GPT-OSS today?**](https://i.redd.it/2br9oi8178hf1.png) ([Score: 289, Comments: 67](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1midi67/gptoss_today/)): **The post discusses a major near-merge pull request to llama.cpp (PR #15091) that adds support for the new GPT-OSS model, an open-weight model from OpenAI. The linked image likely displays terminal output or stats related to running GPT-OSS locally. Commenters confirm GPT-OSS is already operational in several projects: OpenAI's Harmony (https://github.com/openai/harmony) now supports GPT-OSS, Hugging Face Transformers v4.55.0 includes it, and GGUF-format models are accessible here: https://huggingface.co/collections/ggml-org/gpt-oss-68923b60bee37414546c70bf.** Comments highlight the rapid integration of GPT-OSS across major tooling, and the community is already leveraging GGUF models in local inference frameworks.

THANK YOU SO MUCH OPENAI!**](https://i.redd.it/7e3v67opr8hf1.jpeg) ([Score: 241, Comments: 39](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1migo6d/i_feel_so_safe_thank_you_so_much_openai/)): **The post critiques an OpenAI product release, noting that the model depicted is lacking in general knowledge and coding ability compared to a similar-sized GLM (likely GLM-4 or GLM Air). The title and selftext, paired with the image (which is presumably a sarcastic take on safety or model alignment), suggest skepticism about the model's practical use cases, especially given its perceived limitations. Technical commenters echo that the model performs poorly—one calls it 'lobotomized'—and question the motives behind its release, implying it's more marketing than substance.** Users debate the model's utility, strongly suggesting that it's mainly a marketing move by OpenAI and criticizing both the product's capabilities and the surrounding hype cycle.
    - Criticism is raised regarding heavy-handed safety and content restrictions in models, with some users arguing that over-censoring ("safetymaxxing") significantly diminishes the model's general knowledge utility. This perceived 'lobotomization' results in the model being less capable across a broad range of queries, not just in restricted topics.
    - There is skepticism about the long-term relevance of hyped safety-forward model releases; the sentiment is that initial excitement fades quickly, especially if the restrictive policies render the model uncompetitive in practical utility or versatility compared to less-restricted alternatives.
- [**Anthropic's CEO dismisses open source as 'red herring' - but his reasoning seems to miss the point entirely!**](https://i.redd.it/9z1vbpnsu4hf1.png) ([Score: 390, Comments: 203](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1mi0co2/anthropics_ceo_dismisses_open_source_as_red/)): **The image referenced is likely a screenshot quoting Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei's comments from a recent Big Technology Podcast, where he characterizes open source AI as a 'red herring', i.e., not the core problem in AI progress or safety. The post and technical comments criticize this stance, noting that access to powerful models (not running inference) is the real bottleneck, and suggesting that Anthropic's technical limitations with inference further weaken Amodei's argument.

The user provides a series of creative, detailed prompts and notes improvements in Qwen's ability to faithfully follow instructions. Top comments highlight that while prompt adherence is strong, the outputs often have an 'AI' or photomontage quality and may lag behind top models per benchmarking sites such as [genai-showdown.specr.net](http://genai-showdown.specr.net/).** Comments raise concerns about image realism and visual quality, with multiple users stating outputs appear 'unrealistic' or 'like a bad photoshop,' suggesting that fidelity to prompts does not necessarily produce photorealistic or natural-looking images. There's also debate as to whether Qwen's performance matches SOTA, referencing external benchmarks.
    - There is discussion about prompt adherence and visual realism: while users note significant improvements in prompt obedience for Qwen's image model (with some suggesting it is on par with GT4-o), there are critiques that outputs still look artificial or reminiscent of crude digital edits, highlighting ongoing challenges in generative model realism.
    - One comment references [https://genai-showdown.specr.net](https://genai-showdown.specr.net/), which aggregates benchmark comparisons for generative models, implicitly suggesting that claims about Qwen's prompt adherence being equal to GT4-o are not fully supported by head-to-head benchmark results.
    - Qwen's image model displays strong multilingual capabilities, as evidenced by examples of detailed and contextually accurate image generation from prompts in Spanish, demonstrating competitive performance across languages.
- [**Qwen image prompt adherence is amazing**](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mibnmz) ([Score: 140, Comments: 19](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1mibnmz/qwen_image_prompt_adherence_is_amazing/)): **The post demonstrates the high prompt adherence of the Qwen-Image model (specifically the** `gguf Q5_k_m` **variant, available [here](https://huggingface.co/city96/Qwen-Image-gguf/tree/main)), by generating images—such as a complex request for a 1920s archival photo with a datamoshed, glitched subject—using a 20-step inference process. Example outputs can be previewed [here](https://preview.redd.it/xas7a16z78hf1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd3adedaf54f97df762a1e4015c359d21f4178c7), and additional images are provided via a linked [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1O0fmV7hXO23r54JEyL-fKtbe2hGMExp2). The technical showcase focuses on the model's capacity for rendering fine-grained prompt details and complex visual effects like RGB glitches and emulsion artifacts.** Commenters note the model's strong baseline performance and express interest in the potential for further fine-tuning, indicating its adaptability for more tailored generative tasks.
    - Discussion references the Qwen model's impressive image prompt adherence and inpainting capabilities, with user-provided screenshots ([example1](https://preview.redd.it/xas7a16z78hf1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd3adedaf54f97df762a1e4015c359d21f4178c7), [example2](https://preview.redd.it/8dsepfhzw8hf1.png?width=2557&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6c90c26f911868fbf6bcd5652cf5104783ef47f)) demonstrating strong results particularly in the context of inpainting.

The user only increased inference steps to 30, otherwise following the standard procedure from Qwen-Image's official documentation. The result, per their account, matched complex multi-element prompts with high fidelity on the first try, indicating robust conditional image synthesis and improved prompt-following behavior (as detailed at https://docs.comfy.org/tutorials/image/qwen/qwen-image).** Commenters discuss technical resource requirements (the fp8 model reportedly needing ~20GB VRAM), reflecting possible hardware limitations for local use. Further comments appreciate the model's narrative capability and draw parallels to quality leaps seen with new diffusion models.
    - One comment highlights that the FP8 version of Qwen-Image requires 20GB VRAM, indicating high resource demands for full-precision inference, which may impact accessibility for users depending on hardware capabilities.
    - A user asks about integration with platforms like Forge versus Comfy, expressing uncertainty about compatibility and required architecture, suggesting that deployment details for Qwen-Image are still a point of confusion for some implementers.
    - It is notable that Qwen-Image achieves high-quality output and prompt adherence without the need for external LoRAs (Low Rank Adapters), unlike other models such as Flux which often require targeted LoRAs for similar performance, pointing toward architectural or training improvements in Qwen-Image.
- [**Why Qwen-image and SeeDream generated images are so similar?**](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mi7rbe) ([Score: 107, Comments: 52](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1mi7rbe/why_qwenimage_and_seedream_generated_images_are/)): **The OP observes near-identical image outputs between Qwen-image and SeeDream 3.0 when given the same prompt ("Chinese woman" and "Chinese man"), raising questions about potential overlap in training datasets or post-training procedures. Notably, Qwen-image is open-source, and SeeDream has since updated to version 3.1, which diverges in image style from 3.0.** A technically relevant commenter notes a recurring 'orange hue' in several generations from these models, suggesting a possible artifact or bias in color representation in output, which may be linked to data or model training specifics.
    - Some users speculate that Qwen-image and SeeDream might produce visually similar images due to being trained on overlapping or even identical datasets, possibly including prompts or data drawn from major sources like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, or Flux. This shared training foundation could explain similarities in generated outputs across models.
    - Notably, users have observed consistent visual motifs—such as a recurring orange hue across multiple generations from these models. This suggests possible common preprocessing pipelines or dataset biases introduced during training, which may propagate into the model outputs regardless of prompt.
    - The discussion points out how the open-sourcing of such powerful generative models enables broad scrutiny, comparison, and reverse engineering—providing a unique lens to trace the evolution and biases of these systems compared to proprietary counterparts.
- [**🚀🚀Qwen Image [GGUF] available on Huggingface**](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1mi4enh/qwen_image_gguf_available_on_huggingface/) ([Score: 188, Comments: 74](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1mi4enh/qwen_image_gguf_available_on_huggingface/)): **The thread announces the availability of Qwen Image GGUF models (including Q4K M quants) on HuggingFace, with links to multiple repositories: lym00/qwen-image-gguf-test, city96/Qwen-Image-gguf, a separate GGUF text encoder (unsloth/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct-GGUF), and the VAE safetensors for ComfyUI. The Q4 quantized model alone is about 11.5GB, excluding VAE and text encoder, making it challenging to run on consumer GPUs with less VRAM (e.g., RTX 3060). GGUF format allows local inference, but does not speed up rendering, and VRAM remains a significant bottleneck, with 32GB+ only providing limited relief for latest generative models.** Top comments highlight frustration with model sizes and VRAM constraints, noting lower quantization yields poor results. There is discussion of the lack of practical multi-GPU support for diffusion models and a desire for unified memory (as with TPUs). Examples for ComfyUI usage are also linked, providing practical workflows.
    - GGUF format enables local inference for large generative image models like Qwen, but VRAM is currently the key limitation: for instance, the Q4 quantized model alone is 11.5GB, not counting additional requirements for VAE and text encoders, making it impossible to run on GPUs with limited VRAM (like RTX 3060 with 12GB) [source](https://huggingface.co/). Lower quantization (e.g. Q4) significantly reduces quality, while FP8 remains slow on consumer GPUs.
    - Although GGUF makes it technically possible to run these models locally, practical performance and speed are bottlenecked by lack of multi-GPU support—most workflows can only distribute separate tasks, not split core diffusion computation across GPUs. There is anticipation for better hardware integration, such as unified memory via TPUs, but current advances are not keeping pace with model demands.
    - Various quantization and precision options are available—such as Dfloat11 and FP8—but users still report difficulty in identifying optimal generation settings (e.g., cfg params). Community resources like ComfyUI examples (see: https://comfyanonymous.github.io/ComfyUI_examples/qwen_image/) are being curated to help with guidance, but best practices are still being developed.
- [**Qwen-image now supported in Comfyui**](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/pull/9179) ([Score: 208, Comments: 67](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1mhzrsz/qwenimage_now_supported_in_comfyui/)): **Qwen-image, a potent image generation model, now has integration with ComfyUI, as well as SwarmUI ([docs](https://github.com/mcmonkeyprojects/SwarmUI/blob/master/docs/Model%20Support.md#qwen-image)). Benchmarking on a 4090 (Windows), inference times are about** `45 sec/image` **at** `CFG=4`**,** `Steps=20`**,** `Resolution=1024` **(or similarly for** `CFG=1`**,** `Steps=40`**). The model requires high VRAM due to its large text encoder and parameter size, and optimal results are reported at high steps/CFG, but with substantial tradeoffs in speed. Noted technical strengths include strong prompt understanding, text rendering, and minimal censorship; but inconsistent performance on certain prompts remains unresolved.** Commenters debate parameter configurations (CFG/Steps/Resolution) for balancing quality and speed, and note that `quantized` model versions are necessary for broader accessibility due to high compute requirements. One user also remarks on the need for svqd (possibly semantic vector quantization) support.
    - Qwen-image is now supported in both ComfyUI and SwarmUI, with technical docs for SwarmUI detailing configuration parameters. Users report that optimal generation quality for Qwen-image requires high values (CFG=4, Steps=50, res=1024+), but this greatly increases inference time (e.g., CFG=4, Steps=20, Res=1024 takes ~45 seconds per image on an RTX 4090). Lower CFG or Steps runs faster but degrades output quality; using quantized (quants) versions or LoRAs is suggested for speed improvements on less powerful GPUs.
    - The model's text encoder and parameters demand significant VRAM and computational resources—commenters highlight the necessity for quantized or GGUF (for llama.cpp compatibility) versions to broaden accessibility for users with limited hardware. The image model is praised for its prompt fidelity, ability to render text, minimal censoring, and recognition of pop culture IPs, though it shows instability on some prompts.
    - Request for SVQD (vector quantization) and GGUF file formats shows community interest in efficiency and wider deployment, especially for smaller GPUs, aligning with broader trends of porting large models to lightweight, accessible formats.

> `Residual rephrasing optimization trick, HRM Stability, Scaling HRMs, Deep Equilibrium Models, OpenAI's GPT OSS 20B and 120B models` 


- **Residual Rephrasing Enables Cool Optimization Trick**: A member described a diffusion-like optimization trick where you estimate the difference to some target point and can apply **stop_grad** on the inputs for a free backprop to the previous inputs, which is enabled by residual rephrasing.
   - They claimed the network appears to learn quite well with the original formulation, and this may provide even better support to the inner network like this.
- **Stability concerns with HRM Scaling**: Members discussed that one concern with **Hierarchical Recurrent Models (HRM)** is that using the last grad only might only work because the L, H loops are short and might not converge for longer loops.
   - Another member stated that stability is one of the big issues with UTs and the largest UTs trained since 2015 are in the <40M param regime.
- **Deep Supervision Trumps Two Steps?**: An experiment showed that both **one-step** and **two-step** training modes achieved similar performance during validation for Hierarchical Recurrent Models (HRM) with deep supervision.
   - One member thought this made them even more suspicious of a prior paper's claims about needing two steps, if you are using deep supervision.
- **DEQs Style Thinking is Incorrect**: A member argued that **Deep Equilibrium Networks (DEQs)** style thinking is an entirely incorrect way of thinking about UTs, because *you give up expressiveness for stability, and you pay more FLOPs for it*.
   - They posited UTs would need a new paradigm effectively to be competitive at all, and noted that DEQs make too many assumptions (especially convering towards *a* fixed point, not a distribution of those.)
- **GPT OSS is here with 20B and 120B models**: The OpenAI community discussed the release of **GPT OSS** models, available on Hugging Face ([20B version](https://huggingface.co/openai/gpt-oss-20b) and [120B version](https://huggingface.co/openai/gpt-oss-120b)).

> `PP=0 layer naming, TE benchmarking, TE with rmsnorm` 


- **PP=0 Layer Naming Requires Renaming Files**: Members discussed that there is nothing fundamental preventing **PP=0** from working, but the naming of layers changes because the model isn't wrapped in a deepspeed model pipe class.
   - It was mentioned that adding **PP=0** support would be mildly tedious but not difficult, either by renaming the files or adding a modified loader.
- **TE Benchmarking Not Faster**: One member inquired if another member had tried **TE (Tensor Engine)** and benchmarked it, noting that their own retries didn't seem faster.

- **Kaggle Knows Nothing about Chess**: Members expressed amusement and confusion over [Kaggle's AI Game Arena competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/AI-Game-Arena), questioning why a non-reasoning model was included.
   - One member shared a GitHub link showing [Go will be added to Game Arena in the future](https://github.com/google-deepmind/game_arena/blob/main/game_arena%2Fharness%2Fformatters%2Fgo_test.py), adding Go is harder than chess.
- **Quantization Quells Size Concerns**: Discussion arose around the [model card](https://huggingface.co/openai/gpt-oss-120b) on Hugging Face reporting only 60GB for a 120B model, leading to questions about quantization.
   - It was clarified that **MXFP4 quantization** reduces the memory footprint, allowing the larger model to fit on a single 80GB GPU and the smaller model to run on systems with as little as 16GB memory.

   - They tested Claude Code for automating the whole ML pipeline, and they suggested that all sorts of LLM systems lack being forced to **double check everything**.
- **Deepseek-R1 still stronger than Kimi-K2 and GLM4.5**: Members stated that despite the hype neither **Kimi-K2** nor **GLM4.5** have managed to surpass good ol' **Deepseek-R1**.
   - However, **R1** is considered very unusable because it's very slow.
- **Attention Sink Layers are the new Learned Attention**: HuggingFace's Transformers library now uses **attention layers** which use *a learned attention sink per-head, where the denominator of the softmax has an additional additive value*, [according to a new release](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/releases/tag/v4.55.0).

> `Decorators in Mojo, Zig-style reflection in Mojo, JavaScript Runtime in Mojo` 


- **Python Decorators vs Java Annotations**: A member expressed appreciation for the ease of use of **Python decorators** compared to **Java annotations**.
   - The member requested that the Modular Mojo team make decorators in Mojo as simple and flexible as they are in Python, allowing for defining logic at either compile time or runtime.
- **Zig-style Reflection System**: The discussion around decorators on a struct is leaning towards a **Zig-style reflection system** for adding functions, modifying the struct, and adding new struct members.
   - While function wrappers are relatively easy to handle in Mojo, tearing apart a function and throwing it into a compiler will be as difficult as it is in Java, as it involves writing what is effectively a compiler pass.
- **JavaScript Runtime Valokto Written in Mojo**: A member created a **JavaScript runtime** called **Volokto** and put the entire source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/BudNoise/Birdol), written in TypeScript.
   - The runtime features user-made functions, nested control flow, and function calling with arguments; the bytecode resembles CPython, and a dictionary type and console were implemented.
- **Debug Assertions**: A member encountered **34 warnings** in the compiler due to the use of `if DEBUG:` statements.
   - Another member suggested using [debug_assert](https://github.com/modular/modular/blob/main/mojo/stdlib/stdlib/builtin/debug_assert.mojo) or [param_env](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/stdlib/sys/param_env/) instead.

- ****CuTe's Vector Store Problems****: A user is facing issues with **CuTe** not generating a proper **128-bit vectorized store** from registers to global memory, despite using a **float4**.
   - Instead of **STG.E.128**, the compiler emits two separate **STG.E.64** instructions, which breaks memory coalescing across threads.
- ****Dissecting the LDG.E.128 vs STG.E.64 Dilemma****: The compiler emits a correct **LDG.E.128** instruction when loading from global memory into registers.
   - However, when storing back to global memory, the compiler uses two **STG.E.64** instructions, leading the user to question the support for **STG.E.128** or potential misconfiguration.
- ****Memory Coalescing Concerns Raised****: The user highlights that the use of two separate **STG.E.64** instructions, instead of a single **STG.E.128**, breaks memory coalescing across threads.
   - This is concerning because vectorized stores are expected to ensure data is written in a contiguous manner for optimal performance.
