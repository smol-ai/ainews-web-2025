Three months after Claude Artifacts ([our coverage here](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-claude-crushes-code-92-humaneval-and/)), [OpenAI released Canvas](https://openai.com/index/introducing-canvas/), an enhanced writing and coding tool based on GPT-4o ([Mikhail Parakhin also notes that they shipped a similar feature in Bing Copilot](https://x.com/MParakhin/status/1841916242229395539)). From the release announcement, Canvas includes:   

- **Inline Suggestions:** Canvas provides inline suggestions and direct actions for refining writing and coding, such as adding polish, fixing bugs, or porting code.

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/eeae39d2-c8bb-4a22-8641-8452a8614a4a.png?w=960&fit=max)

- **Seamless Editing:** It supports seamless editing of larger documents and complex codebases, making project management easier.

- **Collaborative Environment:** The collaborative environment ensures continuous improvement and evolution of your work.

A quick scan of early commentary and feedback included:

- Vincente Silveira [noted](https://x.com/vicentes/status/1841931637631942887):
"Looks great, we just tried it, compared w Cursor and Claude, and seems it brings more of the core editing and coding use cases into ChatGPT with a better UX for the average user."

- Machine Learning Street Talk [tweeted early issues](https://x.com/MLStreetTalk/status/1841928399809286247) however:
"OpenAI cloned the functionality inside @cursor_ai i.e. the apply model. Nice idea, poor execution - it doesn't work very well. Often updates the entire doc, not the selection"

- Karina Nguyen (who worked on Canvas) [posted several examples](https://x.com/karinanguyen_/status/1841889811931791642) of writing and coding using Canvas.

While the early emphasis seems to be on writing usecases, [integrating well with ChatGPT's existing search](https://x.com/karinanguyen_/status/1841889814230061480), coding is of course an important comparator vs Claude Artifacts, and Karina has built in some custom tools for those tasks.

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/e5be389f-89ab-4397-ab28-126fce561a1f.png?w=960&fit=max)

[OpenAI will also be sponsoring Marijn Haverbeke](https://x.com/romainhuet/status/1841889813105971646), the creator and maintainer of the open source libraries [ProseMirror and CodeMirror](https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/) used in making Canvas.


![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/4babbfd3-ad16-454a-8957-d5c03156d3c4.png?w=960&fit=max)

The trickiest part of the implementation was the way in which OpenAI chose to integrate it into the existing ChatGPT experience, which involved training a detector for when the canvas feature should toggle on:

> **A key challenge was defining when to trigger a canvas.** We taught the model to open a canvas for prompts like “Write a blog post about the history of coffee beans” while avoiding over-triggering for general Q&A tasks like “Help me cook a new recipe for dinner.” For writing tasks, we prioritized improving “correct triggers” (at the expense of “correct non-triggers”), reaching 83% compared to a baseline zero-shot GPT-4o with prompted instructions. They shared their evals too:

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/ccd59cc8-a7d9-4e46-965b-e041959a0aa3.png?w=960&fit=max)

Similar improvements were done for triggering edit behavior and comment creation. This probably means the `chatgpt-4o-latest` model in API has been updated as well.

Unlike Artifacts, OpenAI Canvas does not support displaying Mermaid Diagrams or HTML previews. Presumably those features are in the works, but it is curious both that they weren't prioritized and that this was also not launched at Dev Day 2 days ago ([the Latent Space recap here](https://www.latent.space/p/devday-2024)).
