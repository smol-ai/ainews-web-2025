<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->Hi alpha testers!

That's right, there's now a custom intro for these newsletters. We're very flattered that hundreds of you have somehow found this crappy MVP and so I decided to put in a little last-mile human touch commentary. 

The big news of the day is of course Google Gemini. Multiple discords talking about it - the marketing is great, but people are rightly skeptical. Chief among them is that the central MMLU claim is based on 32-shot chain of thought: ![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/1974364b-279d-49d2-b9ef-304fb9c2d5ae.png?w=960&fit=max) 


We will know more on Dec 13th.

in other news:

- our bot now attempts to read links dropped by users. So for example, if you see the Latent Space Paper Club, we drop in arxiv links, and the summarizer knows the title and abstract of those papers. same for twitter/youtube/hn etc.
- discord links now head straight to the first message captured, thanks to Sam Ching for feedback.

til tomorrow,

- **Discussion on AWS Aurora Limitless**: User `@rafaelnadal` brought up a discussion about **AWS Aurora Limitless**, AWS's new competitor to Yugabyte/Cockroach. The user wondered why AWS launched its product later than its competitors (Yugabyte and Cockroach started in 2015/2016) and if this indicates a large market for distributed/Active-Active, ACID databases.
