Model distillation is most often talked about for autoregressive LLMs, but the impact is often the most impressive for diffusion models, because the speedups for **going from 100-200 step sampling down to 1-4 steps** are dramatic enough to enable order-of-magnitude new capabilities like "realtime" generate-as-you-type experiences like [BlinkShot](https://www.blinkshot.io/) and FastSDXL (now [Flux Schnell](https://fal.ai/models/fal-ai/flux/schnell)).

This generation of very fast-and-good image models was enabled by consistency model research led by [Yang Song et al](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=o_J2CroAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and applied to Stable Diffusion by [Latent Consistency Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04378) and [LCM-LoRA](https://stable-diffusion-art.com/lcm-lora/). After the departure of his coauthor Ilya, Yang is now back with "sCM"s - [blogpost here](https://openai.com/index/simplifying-stabilizing-and-scaling-continuous-time-consistency-models/), [paper here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11081) - a set of algorithmic improvements fixing everything unstable about prior approaches.

By the popular FID metric, they estimate that sCMs can reach less than 10% FID difference in 2 steps compared to the full model:

These improvements also enable scaling up continuous-time CMs to an unprecedented 1.5B params - enabling greater quality. The model isn't released, but it will not be long now for the researchers who can parse the 38 pages of diffusion math to replicate this in the wild.

> - `Noise Assignment in Diffusion Models`
> - `InfoVAE Concepts`
> - `Representation-Conditioned Generation`
> - `Mutual Information in VAEs`
> - `Linear Assignment Problem Complexity`

- **Exploring Noise Assignment in Diffusion Models**: The discussion centered around how to effectively assign noise in diffusion models to enhance generation, suggesting a model that maps images to more informative latent Gaussian noise.
  
  - Concerns were raised about the complexity of the linear assignment problem, which scales poorly with dimension, making it impractical for high-dimensional images.
- **InfoVAE Insights on Latent Representations**: Participants highlighted the significance of maximizing mutual information between inputs and latent spaces in VAEs, allowing for simpler encodings that still match marginal distributions.
  
  - This approach aims to enhance the decoder's efficiency, ensuring that the latent space retains informative structure without excessively complicating the assignment process.
- **Representation-Conditioned Generation Framework**: A new method, Representation-Conditioned Generation (RCG), was introduced to close the gap between unconditional and conditional generation by leveraging self-supervised learned semantic representations.
  
  - This technique aims to improve generation quality without human-annotated labels, presenting a potential solution to the challenges faced in unconditional generative models.
- **Implicit Learning in Consistency Models**: It was suggested that consistency models may implicitly learn noise assignment due to their non-reconstructive loss functions, diverging from traditional reconstructive methodologies.
  
  - This potential insight emphasizes the innovative learning approaches in generative model architectures and their implications for noise assignment.
- **Challenges of High-Dimensional Noise Assignment**: The discussion concluded with a focus on the computational challenges posed by maintaining a noise bank for high-dimensional data and optimizing the assignment process.
  
  - Participants acknowledged the importance of finding a balance between computational efficiency and retaining effective noise assignments for improved generation performance.
