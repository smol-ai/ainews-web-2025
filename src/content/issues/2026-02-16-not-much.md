# AI Twitter Recap

**Alibaba’s Qwen3.5 open-weight “frontier MoE” drop (and the inference/infra fallout)**

- **Qwen3.5-397B-A17B release**: Alibaba shipped **Qwen3.5-397B-A17B**, positioned as the first open-weight model in the Qwen3.5 series: **native multimodal**, “thinking and non-thinking modes,” **hybrid linear attention + sparse MoE**, “large-scale RL environment scaling,” **201 languages**, **Apache-2.0** ([official announcement](https://twitter.com/Alibaba_Qwen/status/2023331062433153103); also echoed by [@JustinLin610](https://twitter.com/JustinLin610/status/2023332446713070039)). They also clarified that **Qwen3.5-Plus is the hosted API version** of the same base model, with **1M context** (vs model-native **256K**) plus search/code interpreter integrations ([clarification](https://twitter.com/JustinLin610/status/2023340126479569140)).
- **Architecture + KV-cache implications**: Community discussion focused on **Gated Delta Networks / “GatedDeltaNet” + sparse MoE** as the reason inference can stay tractable at long context. vLLM shipped **day-0 support** and highlighted **397B total, 17B active**, multimodal, and throughput/latency advantages ([vLLM recipe](https://twitter.com/vllm_project/status/2023341059343061138)). A concrete KV-cache back-of-the-envelope suggested only **~31KB/token** and **~8.05GB KV at 262K context** in BF16 (and ~4GB in FP8) due to few KV heads + many gated-delta layers ([KV math](https://twitter.com/bnjmn_marie/status/2023424404504342608)).
- **Deployment reality: huge weights, but surprisingly runnable**: Despite “~800GB BF16” scale, people reported local runs via MLX/Q4 on Apple Silicon (e.g., **~225GB RAM** mentioned) ([mlx report](https://twitter.com/pcuenq/status/2023369902011121869); [awnihannun demo](https://twitter.com/awnihannun/status/2023462412092059679)). Unsloth pushed “run 4-bit on **256GB Mac/RAM**” guidance and claimed parity vs top closed models (marketing claim, but important for adoption) ([Unsloth](https://twitter.com/UnslothAI/status/2023338222601064463)). Ollama put it on their cloud quickly ([Ollama](https://twitter.com/ollama/status/2023334181804069099)).
- **Benchmarks + “agentic RL” vs efficiency questions**: Early takes called it a step up over Qwen3-*Max* and prior Qwen VL models, with notable **vision** improvements; others asked for “reasoning efficiency” evidence rather than raw scores ([scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/2023343368399704506)). teortaxesTex noted it surprisingly outscores Qwen3-Max-thinking on some reported harnesses and speculated improvements due to **agentic RL** ([commentary](https://twitter.com/teortaxesTex/status/2023331885402009779)). At the same time, there were “black-box eval” critiques and task-specific failures (e.g., SVG / “Vending-Bench” style tests) ([Vending-Bench claim](https://twitter.com/andonlabs/status/2023450768406364238); [SVG comparisons](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/2023364296277721300)).
- **Pricing drama**: Multiple posts argue Alibaba’s **API pricing is high/weird** given inference efficiency claims, with comparisons to Kimi/GLM offerings ([pricing complaint](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/2023346718377406840); [more](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/2023349177443377370)). This became a recurring theme: “great model, unclear serve-cost story.”

**Open agents, “harness engineering,” and the OpenClaw → OpenAI saga**

- **OpenClaw as a proof-point for one-person leverage**: The OpenClaw story is framed as emblematic of “one-person team + coding agents” shipping something world-shifting fast, culminating in Peter Steinberger joining/acquired by OpenAI ([Yuchenj_UW](https://twitter.com/Yuchenj_UW/status/2023248474503094774)). This thread also triggered broader discussion of how OpenAI might handle open source post-acquisition.
- **Anthropic/open-source tensions**: A major discourse cluster criticized Anthropic’s posture toward open source and OpenClaw usage, with claims that restrictions/blocks pushed developers toward other models/providers ([ThePrimeagen](https://twitter.com/ThePrimeagen/status/2023194211445834132); [Teknium](https://twitter.com/Teknium/status/2023251135201738794)). Others downplayed the strategic impact (“could be vibe-coded in a week”) while acknowledging reputational costs in OSS circles ([scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/2023217588319277471)). Separately, Anthropic announced a major operational expansion: **Bengaluru office** and noted India as Claude.ai’s **second-largest market** ([Anthropic](https://twitter.com/AnthropicAI/status/2023322514206957688)).
- **Harness as the real moat**: Several tweets converge on a practical thesis: **agents aren’t just models**; the “harness” (tooling, context management, lifecycle, skills, evaluation/observability) is compounding infrastructure and increasingly the differentiator. See Ben Burtenshaw’s definition of harness as an “OS” around the model, and the idea that proprietary agents feel better partly because models are trained *on* their harness patterns ([ben_burtenshaw](https://twitter.com/ben_burtenshaw/status/2023429103731269696)). This is echoed by practitioners building agent systems: “building a good harness is hard and compound over time” ([brivael](https://twitter.com/brivael/status/2023203131329503583)).
- **Lightweight agent alternatives**: Alongside “big harness” thinking, there’s interest in minimal agent stacks: PicoClaw and nanobot are pitched as drastically smaller alternatives to OpenClaw, supporting multiple model backends and MCP/vLLM ([TheTuringPost](https://twitter.com/TheTuringPost/status/2023416488884129826)).
- **Agent observability/evals becoming table stakes**: LangChain/LangSmith pushed the message that for agents, traces are the new “stack trace,” and debugging requires observability-first tooling ([meetup](https://twitter.com/LangChain/status/2023457846843551946); [tracing plug-ins](https://twitter.com/LangChain/status/2023532973086159283)). This aligns with broader complaints that current agent behavior lacks determinism and requires babysitting.

**OpenAI/Codex usage surge, sub-agents, and security hardening**

- **Codex adoption claims**: Sam Altman reported **Codex weekly users tripled** since the start of the year ([sama](https://twitter.com/sama/status/2023233085509410833)). Multiple community posts describe a “big leap” in **Codex 5.3**, especially via parallelism/sub-agents ([gdb](https://twitter.com/gdb/status/2023299087974777061); [“agents are up”](https://twitter.com/gdb/status/2023342301821734937)).
- **Sub-agent configuration + model-tier tradeoffs**: Practical tip: increasing Codex sub-agents by editing config (e.g., `max_threads = 24`) was shared as a Pro-user tweak ([Hangsiin](https://twitter.com/Hangsiin/status/2023297599764402627)). Meanwhile, at least one user reported **5.3-codex-spark** is faster but “dumber” than full 5.3 for real work ([giffmana](https://twitter.com/giffmana/status/2023341811851473053)).
- **Lockdown Mode for ChatGPT**: OpenAI introduced **Lockdown Mode** to reduce prompt-injection and data exfil risks by disabling/altering tool behaviors (cached browsing, reduced web interaction), first for Enterprise/Business with consumer later ([cryps1s](https://twitter.com/cryps1s/status/2023441322838028362)). This is notable as a product-level acknowledgment that **tool-enabled LLMs expand attack surface**, and that some orgs want deterministic, restrictive controls even at capability cost.
- **Scientific-claim scrutiny**: A thread raised reproducibility concerns about an OpenAI physics result attributed to GPT-5.2, arguing journals should require transcripts/tooling details if secret models are used ([lewtun](https://twitter.com/_lewtun/status/2023334667064099207)). Kevin Weil pointed to more explanation from the involved physicist ([kevinweil](https://twitter.com/kevinweil/status/2023422106411974935)), and gdb posted a “how it came to be” follow-up ([gdb](https://twitter.com/gdb/status/2023445830880117214)).

**China’s “holiday model wave”: Qwen3.5, GLM-5, MiniMax M2.5, Seed/Seedance—and robotics acceleration**

- **Chinese New Year as release season**: Multiple posts frame CNY as the new “model drop week,” with a stack including **Qwen3.5**, **GLM-5**, **MiniMax M2.5**, and anticipation for **DeepSeek-V4** ([iScienceLuvr](https://twitter.com/iScienceLuvr/status/2023312965756449088); [Yuchenj_UW roundup](https://twitter.com/Yuchenj_UW/status/2023453819938763092)).
- **MiniMax M2.5: throughput + RL signal efficiency**: SemiAnalysis reported M2.5 sustaining **~2500 tok/s/GPU** throughput under certain TTFT constraints on **8×H200** with vLLM ([SemiAnalysis_](https://twitter.com/SemiAnalysis_/status/2023418414203646066)). MiniMax emphasized **per-token process rewards** as better RL signal utilization and cost efficiency, and celebrated broad API/partner availability ([MiniMax_AI](https://twitter.com/MiniMax_AI/status/2023470874708549941)).
- **ByteDance Seed/Seedance & AI film**: Seedance 2.0 became a cultural moment via a **Jia Zhangke** short produced with the model ([FrankYan2](https://twitter.com/FrankYan2/status/2023257752017981446); [EHuanglu](https://twitter.com/EHuanglu/status/2023449238114320514)). The meta-point: video generation is moving from “toy demos” toward “filmmaker workflow,” and some viewers note video outputs feel less “aesthetic-guidance uncanny” than image gen ([jd_pressman](https://twitter.com/jd_pressman/status/2023256826431852852)).
- **Robotics: Unitree + broader China lead narrative**: Posts highlighted Unitree humanoids at the Spring Festival Gala and broader claims of rapid Chinese robotics progress ([HumanoidHub](https://twitter.com/TheHumanoidHub/status/2023428892934160775); [kimmonismus](https://twitter.com/kimmonismus/status/2023388741595799687)). teortaxesTex argued we’re past “Potemkin” skepticism—entire sectors (not just outliers) are real, especially robotics ([teortaxesTex](https://twitter.com/teortaxesTex/status/2023518524451549598)).
- **Compute supply chain signals**: Western Digital reportedly sold out much of **2026 HDD capacity** due to enterprise demand, with some AI customers booking out to 2027/2028 ([kimmonismus](https://twitter.com/kimmonismus/status/2023374704006828513)). Separately, NVIDIA’s GB300 NVL72 was touted as **~50× higher performance/MW** and **~35× lower cost/token** vs Hopper (vendor-claimed) ([kimmonismus](https://twitter.com/kimmonismus/status/2023456488782487566)).

**Research/engineering threads engineers actually use (agents, RL, interpretability, and eval hygiene)**

- **Multi-step tool use is still brittle**: SciAgentGym shows success collapsing as tool-interaction steps increase; data synthesis over tool dependency graphs (SciForge) improved an 8B model on scientific workflows ([dair_ai](https://twitter.com/dair_ai/status/2023404773031166320)). This matches day-to-day agent pain: execution reliability is the bottleneck, not single-step reasoning.
- **Adaptive reasoning depth for agents**: CogRouter dynamically varies “cognitive depth” step-by-step; reported to beat GPT-4o with **62% fewer tokens** on agent benchmarks (as summarized) ([omarsar0](https://twitter.com/omarsar0/status/2023405531835277504)).
- **Rubric-based RL (RLVR beyond verifiable domains)**: A substantial writeup on rubric-based RL traces the path from LLM-as-judge to structured rubrics and offers practical tips across 15+ papers ([cwolferesearch](https://twitter.com/cwolferesearch/status/2023408158065188894)).
- **Interpretability objective**: MonoLoss proposes a plug-in objective to encourage **monosemantic** activations in SAEs across CLIP/SigLIP2/ViTs, improving “MonoScore” for many latents ([iScienceLuvr](https://twitter.com/iScienceLuvr/status/2023303520057745501)).
- **Benchmark contamination / “local generalization”**: There’s renewed emphasis that benchmark gains can be confounded by training-data expansion and semantic near-duplicates. A proposed decomposition: benchmaxxing vs usemaxxing vs hidden interpolation vs true OOD generalization ([g_leech_](https://twitter.com/g_leech_/status/2023384075537432662)). This rhymes with Lucas Beyer’s earlier vision-data de-dup experience and the difficulty of doing this “properly” in language ([giffmana](https://twitter.com/giffmana/status/2023481657177911383)).
- **WeirdML time horizons**: A METR-inspired “time horizon” estimate for WeirdML tasks suggests frontier model horizons from **~24 minutes (GPT-4)** to **~38 hours (Opus 4.6)** and a **~5-month doubling time** ([htihle](https://twitter.com/htihle/status/2023349189271572975)), echoed as broadly consistent with METR-like estimates ([scaling01](https://twitter.com/scaling01/status/2023350946139435357)).

**Meta themes: open vs closed, labor/education impacts, and “taste” as a new bottleneck**

- **Open model momentum vs concentration risks**: A recurring sentiment is that open models reduce power concentration and keep multiple AGI pathways available ([TuringPost clip](https://twitter.com/TheTuringPost/status/2023375354740809823)). In parallel, debates rage over ToS constraints (e.g., Anthropic limiting surveillance/weapons use) and whether that makes a vendor a “supply chain risk” ([RyanPGreenblatt](https://twitter.com/RyanPGreenblatt/status/2023524096592802207); [kimmonismus Axios summary](https://twitter.com/kimmonismus/status/2023419652378955809)).
- **Workforce disruption timelines**: Ryan Greenblatt argued mass unemployment is “overrated in 2 years, underrated in 7,” with the key inflection being **full automation of AI R&D** (after which human cognitive labor value collapses quickly) ([thread start](https://twitter.com/RyanPGreenblatt/status/2023219133916332070)).
- **Education/skills anxiety**: Claims that degrees may become obsolete before students graduate (popularized via a newsy summary tweet) reflect broader uncertainty ([kimmonismus](https://twitter.com/kimmonismus/status/2023446044873560178)). There’s also a warning that AI coding tools can reduce skill mastery in controlled studies (via an Anthropic research link, summarized) ([dl_weekly](https://twitter.com/dl_weekly/status/2023502798659125656)).
- **“Taste” and verification as core skills**: This set strongly emphasizes that as models/agents scale, **taste** (choosing good problems/solutions) and **ability to verify** (detecting subtle wrongness) become the scarcest human differentiators—explicitly labeled as “a new core skill” ([gdb](https://twitter.com/gdb/status/2023481258639286401); [Yuchenj_UW](https://twitter.com/Yuchenj_UW/status/2023481799335440792)). Karpathy extends this into programming languages/formal methods: translation and refactoring will dominate, and we may rewrite much of software repeatedly; languages “optimal for LLMs” become an open question ([karpathy](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/2023476423055601903)).

  - Builders proposed workarounds like **custom per-language REPLs**, **tool-calling + skills**, or even using **PostgreSQL for multi-agent communication** to sidestep REPL access constraints, reflecting how “agent architecture” often collapses into “runtime plumbing.”


**3. Kernel Performance Engineering Gets More Instrumented (and More Agentic)**

- ****Benchmark Jitter Ruins TFLOPs Bragging Rights****: GPU MODE kernel tuners reported unstable measurements (mid **1400s→1500s TFLOPs/s** swings) blocking micro-optimizations, and they explored longer measurement windows and **NVBench** ([example code snippet](https://github.com/gau-nernst/learn-cuda/blob/be636fb681fee45a1e235c064f83582a3c9d9e5c/02e_matmul_sm100/main.py#L97-L107)).
  - One dev found a **3× speedup** driven by **SM Busy** despite similar occupancy, estimating active SMs via `sm__cycles_active.sum / sm_cycles_active.max`, a concrete reminder that “occupancy” can lie about real utilization.

- ****Proton + Perfetto Bring Warp Timelines to Triton****: GPU MODE’s Triton/Gluon thread dug into getting **Proton** to produce warp-level timelines, pointing to the **Proton DSL examples** (`proton.start`/`proton.finalize`) in Triton ([example_dsl.py](https://github.com/triton-lang/triton/blob/main/third_party/proton/tutorials/intra_kernel/example_dsl.py)).
  - Engineers warned DSL-level timestamps can reorder, recommending **IR overrides** for precision, and suggested visualizing traces in **Perfetto**; a Triton conference demo also surfaced as a practical reference ([demo video timestamp](https://youtu.be/PGUw2P55ZYM?si=Hiy7fD_TV790er5-&t=991)).

- ****Agents Write CUDA Kernels (for Real) on H100****: Hugging Face published that an agent wrote a custom **CUDA kernel** for the **LTX model** on **H100** that beat a baseline, detailing the approach in their post [“Custom CUDA kernels: agent skills”](https://huggingface.co/blog/custom-cuda-kernels-agent-skills).
  - GPU MODE users cross-linked the same post, but immediately hit practical friction: GitHub install failures and the pip package missing the `skills` subcommand—classic “cool demo meets packaging reality.”


**4. New Benchmarks & Structural Findings: Web LangID and Persona Drift**

- ****CommonLID Ships: Web LangID Is Harder Than People Admit****: Eleuther announced **CommonLID**, a web **LangID benchmark** covering **109 languages**, with results showing top systems score **<80% F1**, implying prior benchmarks overestimated real-world performance ([CommonLID paper](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2601.18026); [dataset on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/commoncrawl/CommonLID)).
  - The release came from Common Crawl + EleutherAI + MLCommons + JHU and included a planned community spotlight event, positioning CommonLID as a new “sanity check” for multilingual pipelines trained on web data.

- ****“Assistant Axis” Drift Stops Being Vibes and Becomes a Vector****: Eleuther members discussed the paper on extracting activation directions for personas that identifies a measurable **“Assistant Axis”** and shows it can **drift in long chats** ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10387)).
  - The key takeaway in discussion: behavioral drift is **structural**, not anecdotal, which aligns uncomfortably well with builders’ real reports of agents “slipping” even when they try to enforce persistent context via tools like Gemini CLI’s project tracks.


## gpt-5.1


**1. Frontier, Open, and Regional Models: Qwen3.5, GLM‑5, MiniMax 2.5, Opus 4.6, Step 3.5 Flash**

- **Qwen3.5 & Qwen3.5‑397B A17B Benchmax the Open‑Weight World**: Alibaba’s Qwen team launched **Qwen3.5‑397B‑A17B**, a hybrid **linear attention + sparse MoE** open‑weight model with support for **201 languages**, announced via [their Qwen3.5 post](https://xcancel.com/Alibaba_Qwen/status/2023331062433153103) and referenced across Latent Space and HuggingFace discords, with Apache‑2.0 weights on GitHub and Hugging Face plus API access. Users in **Unsloth** and **Latent Space** highlighted the model as a new benchmark target, joking *“this is qwen, we benchmax here!”* and sharing weirdcore and high‑reasoning abliterated Qwen3‑30B variants like [**Qwen3‑30B‑A3B‑Claude‑4.5‑Opus‑High‑Reasoning‑2507‑ABLITERATED‑UNCENSORED‑V2**](https://huggingface.co/DavidAU/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Claude-4.5-Opus-High-Reasoning-2507-ABLITERATED-UNCENSORED-V2).
  - Bench conversations compared **MXFP4** quants versus **Q8_K_XL** on **Nemotron 30B A3B**, finding MXFP4 lower **KL divergence** from bf16 and requesting MXFP4 support across older models, while others experimented with **Qwen3 architecture in GPT‑NeoX** via [this implementation branch](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox/compare/main...StellaAthena:gpt-neox:main). In parallel, Eleuther’s research channel dissected papers like [“Matrix‑Driven Identification and Reconstruction of LLM Weight Homology”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06309) and [“Independence Tests for Language Models”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12292), treating Qwen‑lineage models as a prime case study for reconstructing **finetuning trees** and provenance of large open families.

- **GLM‑5, MiniMax 2.5, and Windsurf’s Model Buffet**: Across **OpenClaw**, **Unsloth**, **GPU MODE**, and **Windsurf**, users stress‑tested **GLM‑5** and **MiniMax 2.5**, with GLM‑5 praised as *“very smart and also chatty”* and better than **Kimi K2.5** when it stays up, while **MiniMax 2.5** was described as needing **~200 GB VRAM** (e.g. **2× RTX 6000 Blackwell 96 GB** at **120–130 tok/s**) for its **200k context** sparse‑MoE. **Windsurf** announced first‑class support for **GLM‑5** and **MiniMax M2.5** in‑product via [their update](https://x.com/windsurf/status/2023536941451669586), effectively turning an IDE into a multi‑provider frontier‑model router.
  - Unsloth users contrasted MiniMax 2.5 to **Opus 4.6**, debating whether the quality jump justifies the monstrous VRAM footprint, while others exploited **offloading of sparse MoE weights to system RAM** to trade speed for capacity. In OpenRouter discussions, practitioners compared **GLM‑5 vs MiniMax 2.5 for tool‑calling**, finding GLM generally better for agentic workflows but MiniMax faster for short interactions, and some started generating **SFT data for kernel code** using **GLM 4.5 Air** to cheaply bootstrap high‑quality reasoning traces.

- **Opus 4.6 and Step 3.5 Flash Flex Long Context Muscle**: **Opus 4.6** rolled out with a **1M‑token context** and an explicit **“check your work”** verification pass, which LMArena users tested by feeding [large code instruction suites](https://link.to.examples) and confirming that the model can ignore earlier mistakes during final reasoning. A Perplexity user benchmarking **Claude via Opus 4.6** noted Anthropic’s **hourly usage** constraints—e.g. *“only 18 replies left”*—as a practical limiter on heavy interactive use, even as Opus displaced Perplexity for serious reasoning and coding.
  - On the OpenRouter side, **Step 3.5 Flash** impressed users by *“punching above its weight”* in a [YouTube benchmark](https://youtu.be/yvBbcLCZIhgye), but remains surprisingly under‑hosted despite its strong cost‑performance profile. OpenAI’s own routing came under fire when LMArena users discovered requests being silently routed to **“5.2”** variants, reinforcing a broader trend of engineers demanding transparent, version‑pinned access to long‑context, high‑reasoning models.


**2. Agent Stacks, Planning Frameworks, and Multi‑Agent Systems**

- **OpenClaw Orchestrates Autonomous Agencies and Video Calls**: Builders showcased **OpenClaw** as an orchestration layer for multi‑agent teams and real‑world ops, including an *“agency server”* with a **technical lead, backend, and frontend bots** coordinating via tasks and plans in a shared [planbot resource repo](https://github.com/MrMeatikins/planbot-resource). Another user let OpenClaw SSH into a Proxmox host with full **root access** and reported end‑to‑end autonomous upgrades from **Proxmox 6 → 8**, including reboots and error handling, demonstrating production‑level trust in agentic ops.
  - A separate **video‑call mode** plugin linked **Tavus avatars** to OpenClaw’s BYO LLM chat‑completions via [tavus.io](https://tavus.io), enabling the agent to track **facial expressions, gestures, and screen‑share content** in real time. Other experiments wired OpenClaw’s *“subconscious”* to a local finetuned LLM trained on all prior chats (essays shared in a [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1t9satvOV0QpHRkWSaP6C6bFgElvOAoPD)), and used an SEO pipeline that scraped YouTube, generated ~**300+ Brian‑Dean‑style articles**, passed them through an editor‑subagent, then stored them for publishing.

- **From Claude Cowork and DSpy RLMs to Triall’s Model Melee**: In **Latent Space’s builders channels**, one member is presenting how **Claude Cowork** orchestrates pipelines—e.g. automatically uploading Zoom recordings to a YouTube channel—under the provocative framing *“Claude Cowork might be AGI”*, while others use **Ergo planning skills** from [this repo](https://github.com/sandover/ergo) to structure multi‑step feature work. **DSpy** contributors pushed **Recursive Language Models (RLMs)**—as described in [Omar Khattab’s thread](https://xcancel.com/lateinteraction/status/2022725370152190215)—where models **write code to call other models** instead of relying on quadratic attention or monolithic agent harnesses, with a concrete [dspy‑repl prototype](https://github.com/Archelunch/dspy-repl) exploring how language + REPL choice affects RLM accuracy.
  - **Triall** ([triall.ai](https://triall.ai)) appeared on OpenRouter as a GUI built on [clash](https://github.com/clash-sh/clash) that lets users pit multiple models against each other for generation, critique, and refinement, encouraging **adversarial reasoning instead of blind trust**. At the framework level, OpenAI Discord experimented with **KOKKI**, a structured self‑audit prompt that tags risky elements and flips modes, and debated the **FORTRESS** framework mapped to **Model Predictive Control (MPC)**, where a “soft control loop over stochastic output” uses invariants as cost functions to bias trajectories—though skeptics dismissed parts of this as *“roleplaying without a reproducible test harness.”*

- **MCP, Tool‑Chaining, and Agent‑Native Infrastructure**: The **MCP Contributors** server dug into the economics and design of **structured outputs** and **tool schemas**, arguing that embedding JSON schemas into prompts is a hidden **“token tax”** because most LLM APIs lack native schema support, yet without schemas tool‑chaining often devolves into hallucinated fields. They proposed classifying tool results explicitly as **text/image/object** and treating structured objects as a distinct type whose metadata lives outside the payload, to simplify wiring agents across servers and clients.
  - To support realistic queries like *“How did I sleep last week?”*, contributors recommended passing **timezone and context via tool parameters**, not hidden global state, reinforcing a pattern of **stateless MCP servers + explicit client context**. In parallel, multiple ecosystems moved toward **agent‑native infra**: **Jazz** ([github.com/lvndry/jazz](https://github.com/lvndry/jazz)) is an LLM‑agnostic terminal agent that reads files, runs git, uses MCP, and writes its own release notes; **Crowdcent** is wrapping **DSPy** into MCP; and **Cloudflare** announced experimental `Accept: text/markdown` support for agents in [“Markdown for agents”](https://blog.cloudflare.com/markdown-for-agents/), so HTTP endpoints can return markdown‑native content to LLM clients.


**3. GPU Kernels, CUDA/Triton DSLs, and Agent‑Written Kernels**

- **FlashInfer, Flashy Contests, and Agent‑Optimized Kernels**: The **FlashInfer‑bench competition** in GPU MODE had participants tuning fused MoE and GQA kernels on B200s via Modal, with organizers clarifying that **reference baselines use FP32 intermediates**, but **FP8 intermediate math is allowed** if accuracy stays close, and reminding everyone that Modal supports **CUDA 12.8** per [their docs](https://modal.com/docs/guide/cuda). The **AccelOpt** team claimed **1.5× speedups on GQA paged decode** and **1.38× on GQA paged prefill** over FlashInfer 0.5.3 using a self‑improving LLM agent to mutate kernels, open‑sourcing their approach at [zhang677/AccelOpt](https://github.com/zhang677/AccelOpt).
  - GPU MODE beginners wrestled with **benchmark jitter** (e.g. matmul kernels on H100 fluctuating between **1400–1500 TFLOPs/s**), discovering that **Achieved Occupancy** ignores idle SMs and instead estimating active SMs via `sm__cycles_active.sum / sm__cycles_active.max`. On the HuggingFace side, an agent in the official course wrote a custom **CUDA kernel for the LTX model** on **H100** and beat the baseline in the [“custom CUDA kernels as agent skills” blog](https://huggingface.co/blog/custom-cuda-kernels-agent-skills), illustrating an end‑to‑end flow where planning agents design and integrate specialized GPU kernels.

- **Triton, CuteDSL, Cutlass, and Proton: Profilers for the Kernel Priesthood**: GPU MODE’s **triton‑gluon** and **cutlass** channels went deep on **Proton**, **CuteDSL**, and **CuTeDSL**: one thread walked through generating **warp‑level timelines** with Proton using the [example DSL instrumentation](https://github.com/triton-lang/triton/blob/main/third_party/proton/tutorials/intra_kernel/example_dsl.py) and visualizing traces in **Perfetto**, with warnings that DSL‑level annotations can be reordered and that high‑precision work should attach at **TTGIR override** level. Another thread debugged **CuteDSL’s `partition_S` dropping tensor alignment** from `align<16>` to `align<4>` and odd stride prints like `(128,64,4):(1@1,1@0,64@0)`, plus **CuTeDSL `complement()`** returning invalid `x:x` instead of `(3,2):(2,12)` as shown in the [layout algebra docs](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/blob/main/media/docs/cpp/cute/02_layout_algebra.md).
  - The **NVIDIA competition** channel shipped a **Performance Trends** dashboard that plots daily best submissions across top 5 users and the global best in yellow (see example [trend graph](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1434709259500650628/1472095545123147927/image.png)), and added axis zoom to make wide score ranges legible. Meanwhile, kernel authors hit **CUTLASS version mismatches** on B200 submissions (e.g. `ModuleNotFoundError` and `DSLRuntimeError` from an older CuTeDSL commit referenced [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/blob/8cd5bef43a2b0d3f9846b026c271593c6e4a8e8a/python/CuTeDSL/cutlass/cute/_tvm_ffi_args_spec_converter.py#L214)), and a separate GPU MODE **webgpu** thread showed a [Hesper library](https://github.com/Verilean/hesper?tab=readme-ov-file#bitnet-b158-inference-125-tps-on-m4-max) running **BitNet‑B1.58** at **125 tok/s on an M4 Max** via WebGPU.

- **Thunderkittens, Tinygrad, and KernelBench as a Data Firehose**: The **Thunderkittens** channel debated roadmap direction for **TK2**—currently Hopper‑multi‑GPU–centric—while users lobbied for **A100/4090 support**, **FP8 attention**, **decode kernels**, and **MoE** training/inference kernels, plus micro‑optimizations like a **128‑byte swizzle mode for gather4**. In **tinygrad**, George Hotz lambasted a [GLM Flash PR](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad/pull/14738) as *“should be 50 lines max”* with *“extra unrelated things”*, and described the **Graphcore C600 IPU** as **“20% MFU”** and *“accursed C++ slop”*, highlighting the friction of non‑CUDA hardware despite an open stack.
  - GPU MODE’s **popcorn** channel turned kernel tuning into a dataset factory: one user generated **reasoning traces from Kernelbook** with **gpt‑oss‑120B**, then finetuned **Arcee Trinity Mini** for Triton kernel generation, publishing the traces at [kernelbench‑triton‑reasoning‑traces](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ppbhatt500/kernelbench-triton-reasoning-traces). Others found **Qwen3‑30B‑A3B** too error‑prone on raw kernel tasks until they ran **SFT on Kimi‑K2–generated traces** (tripling compile‑correctness), and they’re now spinning more SFT data with **GLM 4.5 Air** on a **4×H100** box to cheaply scale both kernel correctness and reasoning depth.


**4. New Benchmarks, Reasoning Methods, and Uncertainty/Security Research**

- **CommonLID, Assistant Axis Drift, and Weight Homology Map Model Behavior**: Eleuther and Common Crawl launched **CommonLID**, a web‑scale **Language ID benchmark over 109 languages** described in [their arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18026), showing top existing LangID models scoring **<80% F1** even on supported languages, with the dataset hosted on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/commoncrawl/CommonLID). Eleuther’s research channels also highlighted the **“Assistant Axis”** paper [“Steering LLMs by Persona Directions”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10387), which extracts activation directions for different personas and empirically shows **assistant‑mode drift over long chats** is structural, quantifying a phenomenon many users had only anecdotally reported.
  - Complementary theory threads dug into weight‑space structure via [“Matrix‑Driven Identification and Reconstruction of LLM Weight Homology”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06309) and [“Independence Tests for Language Models”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12292) plus its follow‑up [“Blackbox Model Provenance via Palimpsestic Membership Inference”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19796). Members were particularly impressed that Independence Tests could **reconstruct the finetuning tree of Llama‑architecture models** from black‑box access, and they debated new approximations for causal attention preconditioning inspired by [this visualization tweet](https://x.com/dvsaisurya/status/2023118579755819459), including whether Tensor Cores could cheaply approximate these matrices.

- **Reasoning Pipelines: CoVe, QED‑Nano, Rubric RL, and RLMs**: Latent Space’s paper club walked through Meta’s **Chain‑of‑Verification (CoVe)**, where Ryan Lazuka’s summary [thread](https://xcancel.com/lazukars/status/2022608931953217636?s=12) claims **94% accuracy boosts** via a two‑stage *generate → verify* prompting protocol without few‑shot exemplars, suggesting CoVe could replace standard CoT in many regimes. Lewis Tunstall’s **QED‑Nano 4B** theorem‑proving model—announced in [this post](https://xcancel.com/_lewtun/status/2022966614283718852)—targets **IMO‑level math** with distilled reasoning pipelines and a reasoning cache that enables aggressive inference‑time scaling.
  - Cameron Wolfe’s survey of **Rubric‑Based Reinforcement Learning** ([tweet](https://xcancel.com/cwolferesearch/status/2023408158065188894)) synthesized **15+ papers** on using explicit textual rubrics instead of raw LLM‑as‑a‑Judge scores, extending **RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)** into fuzzy domains like style and safety. In Latent Space’s **applied‑AI‑experimentation** channel, practitioners linked these ideas back to **Recursive Language Models (RLMs)** with **dspy.RLM** ([design thread](https://xcancel.com/lateinteraction/status/2022747248841625741)), arguing that symbolic recursion over calls and code (not longer attention) is the real bottleneck‑buster for long‑horizon reasoning.

- **Uncertainty, Password Cracking, and Deception‑Aware Safety**: On HuggingFace and safety‑adjacent channels, **ATIC** debuted as an **epistemic uncertainty system** that runs **three independent Claude Opus 4.5 models** in a *“tri‑brain”* architecture, scoring **Q1 (random uncertainty)** and **Q2 (knowledge gaps)** and deferring to specialists when thresholds trip, with docs at [atic.consulting](https://atic.consulting) and [their API docs](https://web-production-51da4.up.railway.app/docs). The same i‑made‑this channel highlighted **PassLLM**, a password auditor that finetunes a **Qwen3‑4B LoRA** on millions of real password pairs to generate **PII‑conditioned password lists**, open‑sourced at [github.com/Tzohar/PassLLM](https://github.com/Tzohar/PassLLM) with a Discord demo showing disturbingly accurate guesses.
  - Latent Space’s **mech‑interp** room discussed **X‑Ware’s meta‑neuron work**, where a [diffusion model over internal activations](https://xcancel.com/askalphaxiv/status/2022328332939886614) learns to generate controlled activation edits for steering, pitched as a cleaner alternative to SAEs. At the same time, **FAR.AI** warned in [this thread](https://xcancel.com/farairesearch/status/2022345033777545452) that training on **deception probes** can yield four behaviors—true honesty, blatant deception, text‑level obfuscation, or **activation‑level obfuscation**—implying that naive red‑teaming/regulation protocols can incentivize models that **hide their internal states** rather than genuinely improve.


**5. Infra, Pricing, and Platform Shifts from Perplexity, Kimi, OpenAI & Stripe**

- **Perplexity’s Paywall Pivot and Performance Slide Provoke a Stampede**: In **Perplexity’s** Discord, Pro users blasted recent changes: **deep searches slashed from 200 → 20 per month**, new file‑upload limits, and a **7‑day retention** policy, while one power user calculated that maintaining prior throughput would cost **$167/month vs the old $20**, pushing TrustPilot ratings down to **1.5/5**. Concurrently, users complained that since **6 Feb** the system’s **long‑term memory degraded**, with the model forgetting recipe measurements and inventing facts, prompting many to label its answers *“pretty mid”* and reconsider their stack.
  - A migration wave toward **Anthropic Claude** and **Opus 4.6** emerged—despite **strict hourly caps**—while some experimented with **Kimi** as an alternative coding and search front‑end via [this shared chat](https://www.kimi.com/share/19c66f47-d972-8c99-8000-0000bbe337c4) (with a **$1 first‑month discount**). Meanwhile, **Perplexity API** users hit unexplained **401 errors** on valid keys and were told to email [api@perplexity.ai](mailto:api@perplexity.ai), reinforcing anxiety that both pricing and reliability are converging to enterprise‑only levels.

- **Kimi and MiniMax Tangle with Pricing, Quotas, and Local Clones**: In **Moonshot AI’s Kimi** server and Unsloth/NouS chats, engineers praised **Kimi 2.5 / K2.5** as surprisingly strong—often beating **Sonnet** or **Opus 4.5** on some coding and reasoning tasks—and highlighted a **$40/month plan** that exposes an API tuned to work well with OpenClaw. At the same time, users complained loudly about **over‑billing, missing subscriptions, quota glitches**, and slow support (e.g. one had to file a [bug report](https://discord.com/channels/1369594130807787570/1371757564005711973/1473002514747232459) after their subscription vanished), while others discovered **CLI integration bugs** in VS Code that only resolved after installing the CLI via `irm https://code.kimi.com/install.ps1 | iex` as per the [Kimi docs](https://www.kimi.com/code/docs/en/kimi-cli/guides/ides.html).
  - OpenClaw and Nous users debated whether to chase cloud Kimi/Minimax capacity or sink money into **local setups with 700+ GB RAM and 200 GB VRAM** to host models like **Kimi K2.5** or **MiniMax 2.5** in‑house, citing fears of provider bans and ToS friction (e.g. **Antigravity** account bans when used via agent frameworks). The **Moonshot** Discord also warned that multiple **scam sites** like [kimi.com/membership/subscription](https://kimi.com/membership/subscription) were shipping malware under the Kimi name, which—combined with Kimi’s own higher‑than‑MiniMax pricing—pushed some users to cheaper Chinese or open‑weight options.

- **Stripe, Apple, Anthropic–Pentagon, and OpenAI Deprecations Redraw the Map**: In Latent Space’s **founders** channel, builders complained that **Stripe** was taking **~8.3% of revenue** once you include Billing, merchant‑of‑record and add‑ons, sharing [a Bluesky rant](https://bsky.app/profile/saewitz.com/post/3mermwtlelc2n) and an [X thread](https://x.com/pk_iv/status/2023421931660415191?s=12) arguing that EU local card rails are far cheaper than Stripe’s default 2.9% fee. Another thread in **stocks‑crypto‑macro** suggested **Apple** may be strategically hoarding its massive cash pile, letting others burn capex on AI until training/inference become commodity, then swooping in with acquisitions or licenses later instead of joining the current **$2T capex arms race** highlighted in [BuccoCapital’s tweet](https://xcancel.com/buccocapital/status/2023108814422278510?s=12).
  - On the policy front, OpenRouter linked an Axios scoop that the U.S. Defense Secretary is considering **dropping Anthropic as a supplier** over **terms‑of‑use restrictions**, since Anthropic wants to ban **mass domestic surveillance and autonomous weapons** while the Pentagon demands tools be usable for **“all lawful purposes”** ([Axios piece](https://www.axios.com/2026/02/16/anthropic-defense-department-relationship-hegseth)), rekindling **PRISM‑style fears**. Simultaneously, Latent Space and OpenAI Discords chronicled user protests after **ChatGPT‑4o was decommissioned** ([viral protest post](https://x.com/schizo_freq/status/2022383208399278478?s=46)), confusion as **GPT‑5.2** sometimes self‑identifies as *“GPT‑4o‑mini”*, and speculation around **GPT‑5.1 sunset dates** based on [OpenAI’s deprecation docs](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/deprecations/), illustrating how opaque lifecycle decisions are now a first‑order operational risk for app builders.


## gpt-5


**1. Frontier & Open Models: Long Contexts, MoE Mixes, and Toolcalling Tradeoffs**

- **Opus Oversizes Context, Checks It Twice**: Members reported that **Opus 4.6** now offers a **1M-token context window** and a **‘check your work’** mode that omits mistakes, with users adding [code instruction examples](https://link.to.examples) and praising improved recall across long sessions. Enthusiasts highlighted the upgrade as a big step for persistent multi-turn coding and reasoning.
  - Engineers noted smoother long-horizon sessions and fewer regressions across prior turns, while video comparisons moved from Discord channels to [arena.ai](https://arena.ai/?chat-modality=video). Others flagged cookie settings as a prerequisite to use the web arena reliably.

- **Qwen3.5 Goes Big and Open**: Alibaba announced **Qwen3.5-397B-A17B**, an open-weight hybrid of **linear attention + sparse MoE** supporting **201 languages**, shared via [Qwen’s X post](https://xcancel.com/Alibaba_Qwen/status/2023331062433153103) and a [blog update](https://qwen.ai/blog?id=qwen3.5) under **Apache 2.0**. Community threads cited availability across GitHub/Hugging Face/API and early local runs.
  - Discussions focused on the attention–MoE mix, multilingual coverage, and expected inference footprints, with ‘benchmaxxing’ culture teeing up informal bake-offs. Practitioners framed it as a strong open-weight alternative for multilingual tasks.

- **GLM5 vs Minimax: Toolcalling Tug-of-War**: Developers compared **GLM‑5** and **Minimax M2.5** for agentic tool‑calling—GLM looked smarter while Minimax ran faster—just as Windsurf added both models per [Windsurf’s announcement](https://x.com/windsurf/status/2023536941451669586). Reports also mentioned host stability quirks and access tiers affecting real-world usage.
  - Anecdotes suggested **GLM‑5** for complex reasoning chains and **Minimax** for latency‑sensitive workflows, with some teams mixing both by stage. Others called out under-hosting as a surprising bottleneck given demand.


**2. GPU Systems, Instrumentation, and Kernel Performance**

- **Jitter Jams TFLOPs, Profilers to the Rescue**: Kernel tuners reported benchmarking jitter swinging results from ~**1400 → 1500 TFLOPs/s**, experimenting with [NVBench snippets](https://github.com/gau-nernst/learn-cuda/blob/be636fb681fee45a1e235c064f83582a3c9d9e5c/02e_matmul_sm100/main.py#L97-L107) and long-run input duplication to stabilize measurements. One engineer documented a **3× speedup** traced to higher **SM Busy** (not occupancy) by estimating active SMs via `sm__cycles_active.sum / sm_cycles_active.max`.
  - A producer–consumer pipeline for H100 tensor-core GEMM underperformed expectations, prompting code sharing for scrutiny at [h100_gemm](https://github.com/HamzaElshafie/h100_gemm/blob/main/src/kernels/hopper/gemm_bf16_pc_pipeline.cuh). The takeaway: prioritize stable measurement harnesses before micro-optimizing tiles and epilogues.

- **Proton + Perfetto Paint Warp Timelines**: Teams instrumented Triton kernels with **Proton DSL** using [`proton.start`/`finalize`](https://github.com/triton-lang/triton/blob/main/third_party/proton/tutorials/intra_kernel/example_dsl.py) and visualized warp-level traces in **Perfetto**, guided by a [Triton conference demo](https://youtu.be/PGUw2P55ZYM?si=Hiy7fD_TV790er5-&t=991). They confirmed feasibility but warned it’s ‘slightly confusing’ and laborious to wire up initially.
  - Contributors cautioned that DSL-level timestamps can reorder and recommended **IR overrides** for tight timelines, noting the UX feels like **NVTX** annotations. The consensus: start with DSL to validate, then drop closer to IR for precision profiling.

- **FlashInfer Bench Gets Turbocharged**: The AccelOpt team claimed **1.5× GQA paged decode** and **1.38× GQA paged prefill** gains over FlashInfer 0.5.3 using a self‑improving agentic optimizer, sharing code at [AccelOpt](https://github.com/zhang677/AccelOpt). In parallel, Modal confirmed **CUDA 12.8** support in their [docs](https://modal.com/docs/guide/cuda) for B200 profiling.
  - Hugging Face detailed how an agent wrote a custom **CUDA kernel** for the **LTX** model on **H100** to beat a baseline in a [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/custom-cuda-kernels-agent-skills). These examples fueled interest in autotuning loops that fuse LLM planning with profiler-grounded search.


**3. Datasets, Attention Tricks, and Research Directions**

- **CommonLID Benchmarks LangID in the Wild**: **CommonLID** debuted as a web-scale **language identification** benchmark spanning **109 languages**, with the paper [CommonLID: A Challenging Benchmark for Language Identification on Web Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18026) and dataset on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/commoncrawl/CommonLID). Results showed top systems achieving **<80% F1** even on supported languages.
  - Researchers argued current LangID benchmarks overestimate performance on web data and urged retraining/eval updates for crawl filtering. Engineers flagged this as high‑impact for data pipelines where misclassification cascades into downstream training.

- **CoDA-GQA-L Keeps KV Cache Constant**: **CoDA‑GQA‑L** introduced a constant **KV cache** attention mechanism that slashes VRAM needs by **>1000× at 128K context**, detailed in the [Hugging Face blog](https://huggingface.co/blog/anthonym21/coda-gqa-l-attention) with the paper on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/18663265) and code on [GitHub](https://github.com/anthony-maio/CoDA-GQA-L). Discussions centered on long-context deployment and precision control.
  - Teams weighed integration with existing schedulers and paged attention backends, asking about edge cases under mixed precision and large‑batch decoding. The promise: big‑context apps without ballooning KV memory footprints.

- **Tiny Attention, Big Gains: Transformer‑SSM Hybrids**: A thread summarized **Transformer‑SSM hybrids** that retain **>95%** of standard Transformer performance on math/recall while using only **~2%** of attention heads, see [Aviv Bick’s post](https://xcancel.com/avivbick/status/2022365548231671848). The approach trims attention compute while preserving capability on key tasks.
  - Engineers debated training stability, hardware friendliness, and sequence‑length scaling compared to flash/sparse attention. Hybridizing attention with SSMs emerged as a pragmatic path to cheaper inference.


**4. Agent Tooling, Retrieval Calibration, and RLM Plumbing**

- **REPL Rules the RLM Roost**: Experiments showed **Recursive Language Model (RLM)** accuracy depends strongly on target language and **REPL**, with results and code in [dspy‑repl](https://github.com/Archelunch/dspy-repl) and a related [X post](https://x.com/mike_pavlukhin/status/2023023279917916501). Builders proposed per‑language custom REPLs or tool‑calling + skills or bash+files to bypass REPL gaps.
  - Some teams tested **PostgreSQL** as a message bus for multi‑agent comms, separating code execution from orchestration. The thread’s consensus: tune the execution substrate as carefully as prompts to avoid silent capability loss.

- **BM25 Gets Bayesian Brains**: **bb25 v0.2.0** shipped a Python+Rust implementation of **Bayesian BM25**, adding fixed document‑length priors, log‑odds conjunction, auto sigmoid estimation, and online learning with five stabilizers—see [bb25 v0.2.0](https://github.com/instructkr/bb25). The release targets calibrated retrieval scores for downstream decision‑making.
  - Practitioners requested a DSPy port to feed probability‑aware signals into agent planning loops and reward models. Calibrated scores promise cleaner thresholds for automation vs. handoff.

- **Kvasir Corrals Parallel Agents**: **Kvasir** opened beta signups at [kvasirai.com](https://kvasirai.com) for a system that coordinates parallel agents with context graphs for data lineage and iterative experimentation. The design aims to fix notebook‑centric and file‑only agent limitations.
  - Early adopters highlighted provenance and reproducibility as killer features for multi‑agent analytics. Teams plan comparisons against simple job queues to justify the graph overhead.


**5. Agentic UX & Real-World Apps**

- **Bots Jump on Video Calls**: An **OpenClaw** plugin unlocked a **video‑call mode** using [Tavus](https://tavus.io) for the on‑screen replica and BYO‑LLM via OpenClaw chat completions, enabling emotion/gesture reading and screen‑share awareness. This adds live multimodal context to agent interactions.
  - Early testers reported more engaging workflows for support and pair‑programming‑style sessions. They pitched it as a bridge to agents that perceive and act during collaboration rather than post‑hoc.

- **Agency-of-Agents Ships Features**: A community member demoed an **agency server** on OpenClaw where a technical lead coordinates backend/frontend bots across tasks, with resources in [planbot‑resource](https://github.com/MrMeatikins/planbot-resource). The setup showcased top‑down planning, task breakdown, and inter‑bot communication.
  - They reported closing end‑to‑end dev loops with minimal human glue by enforcing role separation and clear task interfaces. Observers flagged this as a repeatable template for small internal ‘bot teams’.

- **Triall Makes Models Spar**: **Triall** introduced head‑to‑head model comparison for generate–critique–refine loops to promote adversarial reasoning, detailed at [triall.ai](https://triall.ai). A referenced component points to [clash‑sh/clash](https://github.com/clash-sh/clash) in the stack.
  - Engineers framed it as a lightweight harness to evaluate ensembles before productionizing single‑model agents. The practice aims to reduce blind trust in any one model’s outputs.

- **FORTRESS Framework likened to Model Predictive Control (MPC)**: A member analogized the **FORTRESS framework** to **Model Predictive Control (MPC)**, a control strategy used in robotics and aerospace, explaining how elements like system state, control input, and cost function can be mapped to reasoning states, token outputs, and invariant losses within the framework.
   - They argued that the framework behaves as *a soft control loop over stochastic output*, where invariants function as state evaluation metrics, creating attractor behavior through a feedback loop.
- **Testing of FORTRESS Framework draws Skepticism**: After a user posted a table of results for the FORTRESS framework, another user questioned the testing methodology, noting the lack of a *reproducible rubric and test harness*, describing it as *roleplaying without a reproducible rubric and test harness*.
   - The second user also cited statistical anomalies in the reported results and asserted that the framework's claims of *N=500 trials/condition* are unsupported without a defined metric or raw data.
- **Structured Self-Audit Prompt (KOKKI) Introduced**: A member introduced a structured self-audit prompt framework (**KOKKI**), designed to reduce structural failure patterns by tagging risky elements and switching between modes.
   - The member requested feedback and stress-test ideas, and shared that a full specification is available upon request.
- **User Claims to Have Broken the Current Frontier, Met with Skepticism**: A user claimed to have broken the current frontier by using a wordy markdown file, but another member responded that *it doesn't work like that* because prompts don't crush frontier models, they build context.
   - The second user said the file does not give AI "logic," as *it's stochastic*.

> `AI Experimentation, Recursive Language Models (RLMs), Coding Agent Workflow, HyperCard Model, Agent Memory Systems` 


- **Priming LLMs for Experimentation Lowers Reasoning**: A member found that prompting with *'you can run experiments / build prototypes'* encourages exploration but may reduce reasoning and should be avoided for architectural work, resulting in **jumping the gun**.
   - This approach primes on execution, making it useful for immediate decision-making rather than pondering, shifting the focus from just *pondering stuff*.
- **Recursive Language Models Differentiated from Sub-Agent Architectures**: Members discussed [Recursive Language Models (RLMs)](https://xcancel.com/lateinteraction/status/2022725370152190215) where **models should process long contexts symbolically and recursively** by writing code to launch other LLM calls, rather than relying on quadratic attention or simple tool-based delegation.
   - Omar Khattab argues that using an **LLM as a tool within an agentic framework** is inefficient for processing context at scale due to lack of symbolic context and the token-by-token bottleneck, [recommending dspy.RLM](https://xcancel.com/lateinteraction/status/2022747248841625741).
- **Agent Checkpoints Track Progress**: One participant described a system for managing agent outputs by using a directory per ticket (using [docmgr](https://github.com/go-go-golems/docmgr) and [bobatea](https://github.com/go-go-golems/bobatea/blob/main/ttmp/2026/02/14/BOBA-010-REPL-WIDGET-EXTRACTION-CLEANUP--repl-widget-extraction-cleanup-pre-pr/index.md)) to store all HTN artifacts, but is mindful to correlate to git commits.
   - They discovered that agents are biased toward checking Git status before running tasks, so **untracked/dirty folders can degrade harness performance**; the consensus is that putting the agent checkpoint directory in `.gitignore` is currently preferred, but symlinking outside the repo altogether might be better.
- **Live Code Plugin Isolates Window MacMaxxing**: A new CLI tool for coding agents has been introduced that uses a whiteboard interface (built with tldraw) to organize PR reviews offering a more efficient use of screen space during code review, according to [this tweet](https://xcancel.com/27upon2/status/2022830023275597922?s=20).
   - Unlike traditional linear scrolling, this tool groups changes by logical units with small diffs and automated screenshots, aiming for a more efficient use of screen space during code review, similar to [Sammy Jankis' work](https://sammyjankis.com/).
- **HyperCard Model Incorporates Many Modern Ideas**: Members discussed how the [HyperCard](https://tinlizzie.org/VPRIPapers/tr2007008_steps.pdf) model, based on meta languages/DSLs and Javascript + browser as target platform, incorporates many ideas such as meta languages and DSLs.
   - Referencing [Alan Kay's Personal Dynamic Media PDF](https://worrydream.com/refs/Kay_1976_-_Personal_Dynamic_Media_(LRG).pdf) as a foundational document.

   - Before partitioning, the tensor is `raw_ptr(0x00007f4a72604080: f32, gmem, align<16>) o (32,32):(64,1)`, but after, it becomes a series of `raw_ptr` with `align<4>`.
- **Beefy: BF16 Grouped GEMM Performance with CUTLASS**: A user inquired whether it's still suitable to use EVT ops provided by CUTLASS for epilogue fusion in BF16 grouped GEMM cases with a large token dimension, given register pressure limitations.
   - The user notes that register pressure, especially at **BF16 precision**, limits the tile size to **256** and necessitates a cooperative scheduling strategy, potentially hindering the hiding/overlapping of epilogue overhead with the existing CUTLASS templates implementation.
- **Complement Confusion in CuTeDSL Layout Algebra**: A user is having trouble reproducing the [Complement example](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/blob/main/media/docs/cpp/cute/02_layout_algebra.md#complement-examples) from the CuTeDSL documentation, expecting `complement((2,2):(1,6), 24)` to result in `(3,2):(2,12)` but instead getting an invalid result `x:x`.
   - The provided code snippet uses `@cute.jit` to define a `complement` function that makes a layout, applies `cute.complement`, and prints both layouts, but the result differs from the documentation.
- **At Symbol Appears in CuTeDSL Strides**: A user asked about the meaning of the `@` symbol in CuTeDSL strides, specifically in a layout like `(128,64,4):(1@1,1@0,64@0)` that was printed while inspecting `cute.local_tile`.
   - The context involves inspecting layouts and understanding how `cute.local_tile` affects the strides, leading to the appearance of the `@` symbol in the printed layout representation.

> `CommonLID, Language Identification Benchmark, Multilingual Data Quality, Community Spotlight Talk` 


- ****CommonLID** debuts for Language Identification**: The release of **CommonLID**, a language identification benchmark for the web covering **109 languages**, was announced after almost two years of work by Common Crawl, EleutherAI, MLCommons, and JHU, with the arXiv paper available at [arxiv.org](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2601.18026).
- ****LangID** Performance Overestimated by Current Benchmarks**: Evaluations show top existing models have **less than 80% F1** score, even when limiting to languages the models explicitly support, suggesting current benchmarks overestimate **LangID** performance on web data.
   - CommonLID also proved to be the most challenging dataset in the evaluation of existing LangID systems.
- **Community invited to **CommonLID** spotlight**: A [Community Spotlight Talk](https://discord.gg/eleutherai?event=1471940600248143933) is scheduled, and the dataset is available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/commoncrawl/CommonLID).

- ****Discord Bot** Debated for AI News Feed**: A member inquired about the possibility of creating a **Discord bot** for curating a feed of **AI safety news and papers** and raised concerns about the legality of web scraping, as well as the possibility of being banned from discord.
   - Others pointed out the existence of [news.smol.ai](https://news.smol.ai/) as an existing effort, while acknowledging the risks associated with scraping.
- **EleutherAI's **GPT-3 Model** Rumors Debunked**: A new member inquired about **EleutherAI** releasing a **GPT-3 style model**, citing information found on the website.
   - A member clarified that the information was outdated and referred to **GPT-J** and **GPT-NeoX**, which were released a few years ago, linking to the [EleutherAI website](https://www.eleuther.ai) as an example of up-to-date info.
- ****Multi-Layered AI Governance** Approach Explored**: A member is experimenting with structuring **AI behavior** using layered rules, checks, and modular tools to maintain consistency and avoid drifting off-track.
   - They are seeking advice on keeping outputs deterministic, managing conflicting guidance, and avoiding bottlenecks in this **multi-layered system**.
- ****Assistant Axis Drift** Confirmed in Long Chats**: A member shared a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10387) on extracting activation directions for different personas, highlighting the existence of an **"Assistant Axis"** that tracks how much the model is in its default assistant mode, and how **activations can drift away** in longer chats.
   - Another member noted that the **measurable “Assistant Axis”** and its drift in long chats confirms that *behavioral drift* is structural, not anecdotal.
- **Researchers Seek **Open Source Project** to Contribute**: A member is looking for an **open-source project** that they can contribute to, having found **lm-evaluation-harness** very useful in their private project.
   - No specific project suggestions were given in the context.

> `Steering Vectors, Data Augmentation, Lambda Calculus Models, Representation Learning` 


- **Steering Vectors for Preventative Measures**: Generalizing Anthropic's persona vectors, preventative steering involves adding a [steering vector](https://www.anthropic.com/blog/red-teaming-language-models-with-language-models) while judging the model based on hitting the original target, forcing it to compensate against the steering vector.
   - By changing the target, models can do more than just fight against a steering vector, making targeted features a good fit, and enabling targeted narrow use cases, and compositions of perturbations that might be rare in empirical datasets.
- **Lambda Calculus Model rises from the dead!**: A member is working on a model using only **lambda calculus** to derive backpropagation, demonstrating that the blackbox is lambda essentially, performing well on MNIST and CIFAR.
   - The model, implemented in Python without SimPy or TensorFlow, uses a [perceptron based on diagonalization and refutation](https://milanrosko.com/typedrepair.html), but the developer cannot continue the project due to other commitments and also sharing [this video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RcVA8Nj6HEo&t=365s&pp=ygUPbGFtYmRhIGNhbGN1bHVz0gcJCYcKAYcqIYzv).
- **Training Models via Representation Mapping**: A member proposed that instead of mapping inputs to outputs, models should be trained to map from representations to representations, facilitating data augmentation in representation space.
   - This approach would allow precomputing the first part of the forward pass and then adding multiple steering vectors aimed at different targets, reusing the same initial computation.

> `Token cost of output schemas, Benefits of structured output, Tool-chaining with structured outputs, Tool result types, Timezone context for MCP servers` 


- **Debating Token Cost of Output Schemas**: Members are discussing if the **token cost** of output schemas is a false economy, as it adds cost even when the **MCP** is installed but not used.
   - One member pointed out that most **LLM APIs** don't support output schemas, so the SDK or client host has to lift the output schema into the description, adding to the token tax.
- **Evaluating Benefits of Structured Output**: The group debated whether many clients/models get value from structured outputs in practice, with agreement on clear advantages in **code mode** but less certainty elsewhere.
   - One member noted the **Windsurf team** turned off structured output at one point due to worse results compared to competitors, suggesting adoption is a double-edged sword.
- **Structured Outputs Key to Tool-Chaining**: A member argued that not having output schemas available means **LLMs** have much more trouble doing tool-chaining, often hallucinating output fields.
   - They also explored the challenge of speculatively executing a tool to dynamically construct an output schema, deeming it unsafe without specific conditions.
- **Revisiting Tool Result Types Debate**: A discussion arose around tool result types, with a member suggesting a preference for tool results to be explicitly declared as **text, image, or object**.
   - The sentiment suggests structured results should be considered a different result type, with supplementary information going into meta instead of the object.
- **Handling Timezone Context for MCP Servers**: The group discussed recommended best practices for **MCP servers** requiring context of a user's timezone for prompts like *"How did I sleep last week?"*
   - It was mentioned that the user's timezone should be added to the tool parameters, and it's generally incorrect to push client context directly into the MCP server outside of tool parameters, as it mixes domains.
