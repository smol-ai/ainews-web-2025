  The MLOps @Chipro guild discussed key challenges and tools in managing machine
  learning workflows, highlighting platforms like **AWS SageMaker** for
  deployment and cost optimization, and tools such as **Kubeflow**, **MLflow**,
  and **TFX** for experiment tracking and pipeline management. Conversations
  also covered data preprocessing techniques, model training frameworks like
  **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch**, and monitoring solutions including
  **Prometheus** and **Grafana**.
