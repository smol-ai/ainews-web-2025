> AI News for 9/17/2024-9/18/2024. We checked 7 subreddits, [**433** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **30** Discords (**221** channels, and **1591** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **176 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

We humans at Smol AI have been dreading this day.

**For the first time ever, an LLM has been able to 100% match and accurately report what we consider to be the top stories of the day without our intervention.** (See the **AI Discord Recap** below.)

Perhaps more interesting for the model trainers, `o1-preview` consistently beats out our vibe check evals. Every AINews daily run is a bakeoff between OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google models (you can see traces [in the archives](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/). we [briefly tried Llama 3](https://x.com/swyx/status/1828223943301570939) too but it consistently lost), and `o1-preview` has basically won every day since introduction (with no specific tuning beyond needing to [rip out instructor's hidden system prompts](https://x.com/ivanleomk/status/1834749163151802505)).

We now have [LMsys numbers on o1-preview and -mini](https://x.com/lmsysorg/status/1836443278033719631) to quantify the vibe checks.

The top 4 slots on LMsys are now taken by OpenAI models. Demand has been high even as OpenAI is [gradually raising rate limits by the day, now up to 500-1000 requests per minute](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1836506351062716701).

Over in open source land, **Alibaba's Qwen caught up to DeepSeek** with its own [Qwen 2.5 suite of general, coding, and math models](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5/), showing better numbers than Llama 3.1 at the 70B scale.

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/51eb7865-0dfd-4390-b21a-a99fec253057.png?w=960&fit=max)

as well as updating their closed Qwen-Plus models to beat DeepSeek V2.5 but coming short of the American frontier models.

Finally, **Kyutai Moshi**, which [teased its realtime voice model in July](https://the-decoder.com/french-ai-lab-kyutai-unveils-conversational-ai-assistant-moshi-plans-open-source-release/) and had some [entertaining/concerning mental breakdowns](https://x.com/benhylak/status/1808611023123067357?s=46&t=Fski5tAXGapEPufiBpUQQg) in the public demo, finally released their open weights model as promised, along with details of their unique streaming neural architecture that displays an "inner monologue".
