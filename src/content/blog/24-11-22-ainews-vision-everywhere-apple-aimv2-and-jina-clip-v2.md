Inline with the general theme of everyone going multimodal ([Pixtral](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-pixtral-12b-mistral-beats-llama-to/), [Llama 3.2](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-llama-32-on-device-1b3b-and-multimodal/), [Pixtral Large](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-pixtral-large-124b-beats-llama-32-90b-with/)), advancements in "multimodal" (really just vision) embeddings are very foundational. This makes Apple and Jina's releases in the past 48 hours particularly welcome.

## Apple AIMv2

Their [paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.14402) ([GitHub here](https://github.com/apple/ml-aim)) details "a novel method for pre-training of large-scale vision encoders": **pairing the vision encoder with a multimodal decoder that autoregressively generates raw image patches and text tokens**.

This extends last year's AIMv1 work on vision models
pre-trained with an autoregressive objective, which added T5-style prefix attention and a token-level prediction head, managing to pre-train a 7b AIM that achieves 84.0% on ImageNet1k with a frozen trunk. 

The main update is introducing joint visual and textual objectives, which seem to scale up very well:

**AIMV2-3B now achieves 89.5% accuracy on the same benchmark** - smaller but better. The qualitative vibes are also excellent:

## Jina CLIP v2

While Apple did more foundational VQA research, [Jina's new CLIP descendant](https://jina.ai/news/jina-clip-v2-multilingual-multimodal-embeddings-for-text-and-images/) is immediately useful for multimodal RAG workloads. Jina released [embeddings-v3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10173) a couple months ago, and now is rolling its text encoder into its CLIP offering:

![image.png](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/450d6215-203b-4363-baf6-ab42a2edd3d7.png?w=960&fit=max)

The tagline speaks to how many state of the art features Jina have packed into their release: "a 0.9B multimodal embedding model with **multilingual support of 89 languages**, **high image resolution at 512x512**, and **Matryoshka representations**."

The Matryoshka embeddings are of particular distinction: "Compressing from 1024 to 64 dimensions **(94% reduction) results in only an 8% drop in top-5 accuracy** and 12.5% in top-1, highlighting its potential for efficient deployment with minimal performance loss."
