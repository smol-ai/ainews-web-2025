> `Cross-Entropy Memory Optimization, SD3 Paper Discussion, HunyuanProver for Theorem Proving` 


- **Cut Cross-Entropy Memory Innovation**: The paper introduces a method called Cut Cross-Entropy (CCE) that reduces global memory consumption during the loss computation process in language models by only computing logits for the correct token.
   - This method significantly optimizes memory usage by evaluating the log-sum-exp on-the-fly, alleviating the logit matrix's burden, as described in the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09009v1).
- **Confusion Over Forward and Backward Processes in SD3**: A member questioned whether the reference to a forward process in the SD3 paper means it fails to remove all data from noise, speculating it could actually pertain to the backward process instead.
   - Another member noted that they are likely discussing the forward process given the references to the zero SNR paper, indicating potential oversight in the text that has persisted for months.
- **HunyuanProver Achieves Theorem Proving Milestone**: The HunyuanProver, a model fine-tuned from Hunyuan 7B for automatic theorem proving with LEAN4, shows state-of-the-art performance with a **68.4% pass** rate on the miniF2F-test.
   - This system has proven several IMO statements and intends to contribute to the community by open-sourcing a dataset of 30k synthesized instances, enhancing accessibility for researchers ([View Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20735)).

   - *It was noted that weird OOM signals led to process being killed errors*, indicating potential issues in resource handling.
- **DeepSpeed Pipe Module Performance Concerns**: There was discussion regarding the **DeepSpeed pipe module**, where setting it to 0 yielded faster performance despite initial expectations. One member expressed uncertainty about why similar-sized models did not exhibit this behavior in the past.
   - *I suspect that something snuck into DeepSpeed* was mentioned, suggesting recent changes may have affected performance.
- **Clarification on AdamW Optimizer**: Clarification was provided that **AdamW** is simply the **'adam'** optimizer with weight decay. This points to a shared understanding that the benefits of AdamW stem from its improved handling of regularization.
   - The exchange indicated a **sensible** grasp on conflicting model training dynamics among the members involved.
- **Batch Size Behavior in Training**: There was confusion regarding **batch size behavior**, with a user noting inconsistencies found when shifting to the larger model. Discussions indicated that performance changes could be unexpected as model size increases.
   - *Hmm yeah these seem sensible*, but uncertainty remained about why such behavior was occurring.
- **BF16 Loss Scaling Discussion**: It was mentioned that there is *no need to use loss scaling for BF16*, as it has enough range to avoid overflows. If BF16 overflows occur, one member humorously noted that the run would be 'beyond saving'.
   - This pragmatic advice aimed to improve understanding and efficiency in BF16 model training processes.
