   - Some argued that methods like **score matching** and **diffusion models** prove that it’s feasible to compute the normalizer later during inference without hindering training efficacy.
- **Challenges with LoRA**: Participants discussed the limitations of **LoRA** in fine-tuning models, emphasizing that lower dimensional spaces could lead to information loss and insufficient fitting of new data points.
   - While higher-rank LoRA can overcome some drawbacks, it sacrifices efficiency, thus bringing significant trade-offs in model training.
- **Exploring diffusion models for symbolic tasks**: There was a call for more research into using **diffusion models** for discrete tasks like text generation, particularly in real-time contexts.
   - Previous mentions of **LLaDA** showcasing impressive performance in language understanding raised questions about its applicability in producing reliable outputs when trained on limited data.
- **Synthesizing data in model training**: There was uncertainty about reliable training data sources for models using untranslatable or incomplete languages, like dead written languages.
   - It was pointed out that synthetic data, such as that used by **DeepSeek**, might serve as a basis for training in this context, albeit with potential reliability concerns.
