> AI News for 11/26/2024-11/27/2024. We checked 7 subreddits, [**433** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **29** Discords (**197** channels, and **2528** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **318 minutes**. You can now tag [@smol_ai](https://x.com/smol_ai) for AINews discussions!

AI2 is notable for having fully open models - not just open weights, but open data, code, and everything else. We [last covered OLMo 1 in Feb](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-ai2-releases-olmo-the-4th-open-everything/) and [OpenELM in April](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-apples-openelm-beats-olmo-with-50-of-its/). Now it would see that AI2 have updated OLMo-2 to roughly Llama 3.1 8B equivalent.

They have trained with 5T tokens, particularly using learning rate annealing and introducing new, high-quality data (Dolmino) at the end of pretraining. A full technical report is pending soon so we don't know much else, but the post-training gives credit to [Tülu 3](https://allenai.org/tulu), using "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards" ([paper here](https://allenai.org/papers/tulu-3-report.pdf), [tweet here]( https://x.com/natolambert/status/1859643351441535345))) which they just announced last week (with [open datasets of course](https://huggingface.co/collections/allenai/tulu-3-datasets-673b8df14442393f7213f372).

The quantized models are available on **HuggingFace** in both [4-bit](https://huggingface.co/kaitchup/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct-AutoRound-GPTQ-4bit) and [2-bit](https://huggingface.co/kaitchup/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct-AutoRound-GPTQ-2bit) versions.
  - **MMLU** benchmark testing methodology was discussed, with the original poster confirming **0-shot settings** and referencing [Intel's similar findings](https://github.com/intel/auto-round/blob/main/docs/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct-sym.md). Critics noted that **MMLU** might be too "easy" for large models and suggested trying **MMLU Pro**.
  - **Qwen2.5** models show unique quantization resilience compared to other models like **Llama3.1** or **Gemma2**, with users speculating it was trained with **quantization-aware** techniques. This is particularly evident in **Qwen Coder** performance results.
  - Discussion focused on the terminology of "lossless," with users explaining that quantization is inherently lossy (like **128kbps AAC** compression), though performance impact varies by task - minimal for simple queries but potentially significant for complex tasks like code refactoring.


**Theme 2. SmolVLM: 2B Parameter Vision Model Running on Consumer Hardware**

- **Introducing Hugging Face's SmolVLM!** ([Score: 115, Comments: 12](https://reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1h0ffpl/introducing_hugging_faces_smolvlm/)): **HuggingFace** released **SmolVLM**, a **2B** parameter vision language model that generates tokens **7.5-16x** faster than **Qwen2-VL** and achieves **17 tokens/sec** on a Macbook. The model can be fine-tuned on **Google Colab**, processes millions of documents on consumer GPUs, and outperforms larger models in video benchmarks despite no video training, with resources available at [HuggingFace's blog](https://huggingface.co/blog/smolvlm) and [model page](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolVLM-Instruct).
  - **SmolVLM** requires a minimum of **5.02GB GPU RAM**, but users can adjust image resolution using `size={"longest_edge": N*384}` parameter and utilize **4/8-bit quantization** with **bitsandbytes**, **torchao**, or **Quanto** to reduce memory requirements.
  - The model demonstrates strong **OCR capabilities** when focused on specific paragraphs but struggles with full screen text recognition, likely due to default resolution limitations of **1536×1536 pixels** (N=4) which can be increased to **1920×1920** (N=5) for better document processing.
  - Users compare **SmolVLM** favorably to **mini-cpm-V-2.6**, noting its accurate image captioning abilities and potential for broader applications.

> `Model Context Protocol, Aider Upgrades, Connecting Aider with VS Code, Token Limit Issues, Voice Function Costs`

- **Introduction of Model Context Protocol**: Anthropic has open-sourced the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), a new standard aimed at enhancing the connection between AI assistants and various data systems.
  
  - This protocol seeks to eliminate the challenges posed by fragmented integrations and data silos.

- **Challenges with Aider Upgrades**: Some users are facing difficulties with Aider's upgrade process, including issues with command prompts to run necessary scripts or installing packages.
  
  - Others have observed that Aider might not detect newly added files correctly, leading to confusion about its operational consistency.

- **Connecting Aider with Visual Studio Code**: Users have reported that Aider works seamlessly within the VS Code terminal, requiring no special configuration other than ensuring auto-save is turned off.
  
  - This approach allows for direct modifications in Aider to reflect changes in the VS Code environment.

- **Token Limit Confusion**: Upgrading to a higher token limit in Anthropic plans has led to confusion, as Aider continues to report lower limits, though it doesn’t enforce these limits.
  
  - Users can create a `.aider.model.metadata.json` file to define token limits for unrecognized models.

- **Cost of Voice Function**: The voice function in Aider currently operates exclusively with OpenAI keys, costing approximately **$0.006 per minute**.
  
  - This pricing is structured to be rounded to the nearest second, making it easier for users to estimate usage costs.

- **PyTorch's FP8 Training Blogpost Released**: The [new blogpost on FP8 training](https://pytorch.org/blog/training-using-float8-fsdp2/) from PyTorch reveals a **50% throughput speedup** using FSDP2, DTensor, and torch.compile with float8.
  
  - This improvement enables training over the **Meta LLaMa** models from **1.8B** to **405B** parameters, enhancing performance significantly.

- **Dynamic Casting Overhead and Performance**: Discussion highlighted that larger matrix multiplications (matmuls) can better conceal the overhead from dynamic casting due to being compute-bound, leading to improved performance.
  
  - This reflects a bit of Amdahl's law, implying that in larger configurations, the time spent on casting is proportionally smaller.

- **Performance Metrics and Batch Size Exploration**: The blogpost mentions exploring batch sizes and activation checkpointing schemes to report the tokens/sec/GPU metric, focusing on performance gains for both float8 and bf16 training.
  
  - It was noted that while an 8B model uses larger batch sizes, it could be slower with larger M-dim than K-dim for matrix multiplications.
