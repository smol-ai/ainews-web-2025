<!-- buttondown-editor-mode: plaintext -->> AI News for 3/19/2024-3/20/2024. We checked [**358** Twitters](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1585430245762441216) and **21** Discords (**337** channels, and **9841** messages) for you. Estimated reading time saved (at 200wpm): **1033 minutes**.

It's often said that a key sign [a startup has gone bad](https://www.swyx.io/startups-going-bad#signs-that-a-startup-is-going-bad) is "shipping and dipping" - the tendency of top performers who have decided to leave, to try to ship something and leave on a high note. This has just happened to both:

- Inflection AI, who [shipped 2.5 two weeks ago](https://buttondown.email/ainews/archive/ainews-inflection-25-at-94-of-gpt4-and-pi-at-6m/) and now are seeing the [two executive cofounders](https://twitter.com/mustafasuleyman/status/1770123596121432351?utm_source=ainews&utm_medium=email) leave for Microsoft, and
- Stability AI, who [shipped Stable Diffusion 3 two weeks ago](https://buttondown.email/ainews/archive/ainews-to-be-named-7776/) and now have [Rombach et al departing](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39768402).

Senior departures are a fact of life in chaotic startups, but these do feel more major than most. It could be the start of a consolidation/cooling wave in the "hot"/"GPU-rich" startup area, but we're not quiiiite ready to call it yet. Consider us on alert though.

- **Unsloth AI Discord Discusses Grok-1**: Members discussed the new Grok-1 model released by xAI, questioning its usefulness given its size of 314 billion parameters, which is so large that it requires multiple high-end GPUs to even attempt inference.
- **Quantization Queries and AIKIT Integration**: One user shared the addition of finetuning with unsloth as an integration into AIKIT, allowing deployment and fine-tuning of large language models with a configuration file and Docker. Another is seeking resources to understand quantization basics, like bits and the significance of 4-bit quantization.
- **Concerns Over Impersonation on Discord**: There's an alert about a scam account impersonating a user named Daniel (starsupernova), with suggestions to report the impersonator for fraudulent activities.
- **Fine-tuning Discussions and Resources Shared**: The community exchanged information on fine-tuning LLMs, with notebooks shared to help structure datasets for tasks like creating an instruct model and the suitable VRAM required for models like Mistral and Gemma.
- **Grok-1 Performance and Architectural Decisions** questioned: It was mentioned that Grok-1 doesn't significantly outperform Llama 70B, and there's interest in why such a large model was released, suggesting marketing or other motives by Elon Musk and his team.

Another member suggested making sure that 4-bit quantization was adopted for inference and clarified the process of using Unsloth's colab notebook and `eval_steps` parameter.

- **Unsloth Parameters for GGUF Conversion**: One member discussed issues with converting Gemma model to GGUF and received advice to execute a specific Python conversion command outside of the provided cell in the notebook.
  
- **Saving and Conversion Problems**: A user attempting to run the ChatML notebook with a Gemma model encountered errors during the saving process. They received assistance with alternative commands to manually run the conversion in Kaggle or local environments.

- **Support for Full Fine-Tuning Discussed**: Users inquired about the capabilities of Unsloth for full fine-tuning, with the understanding that it currently excels at LoRA and QLoRA. The Unsloth team explained that while full fine-tuning might be supported in the future, it is not currently the focus of Unsloth and manual editing of the codebase would be necessary.

- **Deployment and Fine-Tuning Queries**: Discussion also included guidance on deploying models with Unsloth, focusing on those that are part of the open-source segment (e.g., Mistral) rather than proprietary ones like OpenAI's GPT-4. Further, there was a clarification regarding the impact of `eval_steps` on finetuning outcomes, confirming it only dictates the frequency of evaluation, not the final finetuning performance.

- **Hermes 2.5 Still Reigns**: In the Nous Research discussions, there's acknowledgment that despite Grok-1's massive 314-billion-parameter size, it barely outperforms GPT-3.5, while some 7-billion parameter models surpass GPT-3.5's capabilities. Grok-1's utility is questioned, with speculation over its necessity when LLaMA and smaller models serve well.
- **Yi Licensing Clears Up**: Discussions hint at Yi-9B's license now allowing commercial use with what seems to be an automated approval process. However, there's skepticism, with some thinking this auto-approval could just be a marketing tactic.
- **Jensen Huang's Accidental Leak?**: NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang's GTC keynote possibly confirmed rumors about GPT-4's architecture and scale, mentioning 1.8 trillion parameters and a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) setup, which OpenAI has not officially confirmed.
- **Continual Pretraining Debates**: The channel has conversations on the feasibility, benefits, and difficulties of continually pretraining models, particularly MoE models like Mixtral. While deemed useful for low-resource languages, there's concurrence that without a high-quality data set, this approach could degrade overall model performance. 
- **Open Source vs Commercial Giants**: There is recognition that open-source efforts in large language models (LLMs) may be stifled if well-funded labs continue to keep their models and methods restricted. Some envision a future where each state or large entity maintains their own LLM tailored to their constitutional values, with open-source models serving as valuable bases for continual development.

- **Deciphering Yann's Perspective**: Discussions reveal that Yann LeCun may favor visual or planning models over language because he lacks an inner monologue, as discussed in various tweets including a tweet from @kzSlider with a link to an [interview with someone who lacks an internal monologue](https://x.com/joshwalkos/status/1767745681375015076?s=46&t=6FDPaNxZcbSsELal6Sv7Ug).
- **Views on Linguistic Reasoning**: Members like mr.osophy argue that we overestimate our use of language for reasoning and that visual representations can be more directly mapped to actions, like learning a tennis serve by watching someone rather than translating the visual into language first.
- **Scenarios Leading AI Offerings**: Scene-scenario's new *UPSCALER* tool might prompt Magnific to reconsider pricing, offering image quality enhancement to 10k resolutions, as announced by @emmanuel_2m in a [tweet](https://x.com/emmanuel_2m/status/1768360522028876045?s=46&t=6FDPaNxZcbSsELal6Sv7Ug).
- **GPT Models, Computing, and Frameworks Discussions**: Points of interest include a comment on an extraordinary increase in compute leading to faster model creation by @granawkins, the offering of free GTC virtual session codes by @harpreetsahota, and an in-depth discussion about the scaling and tokenization of multilingual models driven by @picocreator.
- **Grok-1 Enters the Chat**: The open release of xAI's Grok-1, a 314 billion parameter Mixture-of-Experts model under the Apache 2.0 license, is highly anticipated but its effectiveness as compared to other models is questioned in a flurry of tweets and counter opinions. Details and reactions can be followed through [Grok-1's release page](https://x.ai/blog/grok-os) and the conversation thread starting with @gen_being_96's mention of the model.

- **Attention Mechanism Fundamentals Clarified**: One member questioned why attention mechanisms were developed, leading to another explaining that **attention** was created to address the limitation of fixed-length encoding vectors in traditional models, allowing the decoder to **access all relevant parts** of the input sequence.
- **Understanding the Motivation Behind Using Attention**: A member conveyed the lack of understanding **intuition behind design choices** in transformer-based models. Another participant responded, clarifying that attention allows decoders to **focus on the most relevant parts** of the input sequence.
- **Parallelization Perks of the Transformer Architecture**: In the context of **parallelization**, a member elucidated that the attention mechanism in transformers allows processing different tokens **independently and concurrently**, leading to more efficient computation and faster training.
- **Acknowledging Efficient Computation in Transformers**: The importance of **scaled dot product operations** was highlighted, which eliminates the need for "waiting" seen in sequential calculations, thus enhancing the efficiency of models like GPT.
- **Gratitude for Educational LLM Session**: Participants thanked the session hosts, noting that their insights provided a deeper understanding of the **lineage of large language models (LLMs)** and helping to demystify the conceptual underpinnings of the technology.

- **Jupyter Notebooks Accessibility in Copilot**: Microsoft Copilot Pro subscriptions provide free access to Jupyter Notebooks with libraries like simpy and matplotlib, much like the offering in ChatGPT Plus.

- **DALL-E 3 Dataset Update**: The DALL-E 3 dataset was not removed from Hugging Face; it was relocated to a new location which can be found at [Hugging Face's dalle-3-dataset repository](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenDatasets/dalle-3-dataset). Users can use the `load_dataset()` function with a specific revision for reproducibility [as documented by Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/en/loading).

- **Xformers Discussions for PyTorch Compatibility**: Members discussed solutions for integrating xformers with PyTorch, including the use of virtual environments, a specific installation order, and the PyTorch index URL which guarantees a compatible version of xformers.

- **Leveraging Metadata in Captioning Prompts**: One member shared insights about using metadata hints in captioning prompts to improve AI-generated text accuracy. An example script utilizing cog captioning was mentioned, which could be accessed at [EveryDream2trainer's caption_cog GitHub script](https://github.com/victorchall/EveryDream2trainer/blob/main/caption_cog.py).

- **Questions About Vast.AI and Security**: Users discussed the operation and security aspects of running containers on Vast.AI, noting that it does not adhere to strict security standards like HIPAA. Vast.AI operates by providing SSH access to a container running on a host machine, but ultimately, the host has root access, so sensitive tasks should use major cloud providers instead.

- **Troubleshooting Tokenizer Quirks**: In addressing tokenizer issues, a participant is finetuning an instruct model for document summarization but encounters a problem where the model inconsistently generates the `<summary>` tag, sometimes with an unexpected space in front of it. It was suggested to look into potential causes such as whitespace characters.
  
- **Local Dataset and Model Configuration Woes**: A newcomer to LLM is learning how to point a fine-tuning configuration to local datasets and models rather than pulling from Hugging Face. The correct approach is to specify the full file path rather than a relative path, and make sure it's not formatted as a repo identifier that throws a `HFValidationError`.

- **Dataset Dilemmas and JSON Structure**: A member is experiencing 'index out of range' errors while trying out different data types for a conversational dataset. It is suggested to check for empty rows, double-check the readme for conversation options, and ensure that 'role' in the dataset array isn't empty.

- **Bug Hunting: Evaluating Role Mapping and Sample Packing**: One user reported that a role map was missing "bard," "bing," and "chatgpt" in their test dataset. Another discovered an issue where an eval set was considered too small for sample packing during a 2-epoch run but not during a 10-epoch run; a potentially epoch-independent validation bug.

- **Building Custom Completion Datasets**: For building a custom completion dataset, members are advised it’s as simple as making a `jsonl` file with each line containing a JSON object with the text attribute containing the completion text. The README file contains instructions on how this can be accomplished.

- **Deciphering API-Protected LLMs**: A new study outlined in an [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09539) demonstrates that it is possible to extract substantial non-public information about commercially available LLMs through API calls. The research relies on the **softmax bottleneck** characteristic of modern LLMs, which suggests model **outputs are restricted to a linear subspace**, allowing for various analytical advantages, including estimating an LLM’s hidden size.

- **Estimation of GPT-3.5's Size Causes Stir**: Discussion in the channel revolves around recent findings that estimate OpenAI's **gpt-3.5-turbo** to be around **7B** in size. A user expresses surprise at this number, while others are skeptical about the accuracy of this estimation.

- **Skepticism Over Model Size Accuracy**: Nathan Lambert, a participant in the conversation, suggests that the 7B size estimation for **gpt-3.5-turbo** might be incorrect. There is an implication that the estimation doesn't hold up if **gpt-3.5** is inferred to be a **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** model.

- **Potential Disruption by Distillation Techniques**: The skepticism continues with a hypothesis that unless there is some "mega distillation sauce," the size estimate for **gpt-3.5-turbo** is likely erroneous. This suggests reliance on advanced techniques to justify the model's capabilities given the estimated size.

- **Performance Boost through Model Mixture Strategy**: A user points to a strategy mentioned in a paper from the previous year, suggesting that performance can be significantly enhanced by using outputs from a more capable model such as **GPT-4** at the start and then continuing with a different model like **llama** for processing math problems. This might indicate a similar approach could be in use with **turbo models**.

- **Disco Bot Sticks to the Script**: A member noted that the model is designed to adhere to the system prompt, but variations may be tested for optimal results. The demo does not use special settings and operates on **fastchat/vllm**.

- **Server Migration Mixed Success**: There's been a server transfer for the demo, moving from a home kitchen setup to a more robust location. However, the transition has faced networking issues, with hopes to resolve them early next week.

- **Kitchen vs Professional Hosting – A Wry Observation**: A user humorously commented that a hobbyist server in a kitchen may run without a hitch, whereas a professional hosted server is more prone to problems like networking issues and hardware failures.
